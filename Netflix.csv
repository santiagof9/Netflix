au;2;Good idea but is chewing severely through the battery life on my phone.
au;1;Still major issues in kicking out other blue tooth connected devices.  I still have it running as a public duty but the devs need to sort it out.
au;3;Well use John Support Apple Watch, and then use do a mega giant of my battery? And then it’s does not support sun with Apple, and then you want to send a verification code to my phone number? No way, everyone away right this stupid ass one star, it deserves one star, only reason why I rated in freestyle overhear is because that it was made by the government, and the government I hate sometimes too, a child review, people calling people might call me idiot here and cracking on about stuff
au;2;I’m using an iPhone 7 with the latest IOS. I cannot get the pin code to register. Sometimes I get an error message re verifying the phone number. Other times nothing but I don’t get the code. Tried turning phone off and back on, rebooting the phone, switching off wifi, deleting and re-downloading the app, inputting phone number and without the zero. Very frustrated.
au;1;How long will it take to update the app to make it useful for iPhones? Still does not allow screen to shut down. People are not going to use it while it flattens their batteries in such a short time.
au;1;"If my iPhone is out of bluetooth range with my Apple Watch. Neither devices will pair automatically next time within range.

The phone requires a reboot, airplane mode or COVIDSafe to have bluetooth access disabled in privacy.

No thanks!"
au;3;"Since I have installed the app my apple watch keeps losing its Bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone.

I finally ended up limiting Bluetooth access for the app and my watch connects perfectly fine again.

I hope the development team find it useful."
au;3;I have activated the app but it regularly tells be that is needs to be reactivated. Not sure what the point is if it keeps turning itself off.
au;1;Watch, AirPods and Bluetooth keys have all stopped working effectively when this app is running.
au;1;Since the latest update my Apple Watch series 5 edition is no longer staying connected to my phone and as a result my watch it’s constantly going flat because it kicks into independent cell mode. After disabling Bluetooth on COVIDSafe it’s stopped happening and my watch is staying connected.
au;2;Title says it all. But in case people do not understand what it means, I will explain. The Apple implementation of COVID-19 contact tracing stores the data of randomised Bluetooth connections on the device only. At the point where you have confirmed do have contracted SARS-CoV-2, the iOS will then allow the data (that doesn’t have identifying information in it) to be connected with the national database. This will in turn alert those that have been in contact with you. The government doesn’t get to know who everyone else is or track locations. The other upside is it enables Bluetooth to function in the background so you don’t need to drain your battery with the app open all the time.
au;3;Which is not ideal.
au;4;I see the importance of this app and it’s been great. However since I downloaded it I have been having lots of Bluetooth issues. Such as my Apple Watch and my car stereo disconnecting and then I have to restart the phone for it to reconnect. Many of my friends are suffering the same issue. Hope this bug can be fixed.
au;1;"Unbelievable that such an important application wouldn’t adopt the official Apple API that would allow it to run effectively in the background.

Useless"
au;2;"After hearing about the major security flaw about how hackers can easily get into your phone and steal your data thanks to this app, I decided to delete this app

Even though the main reason this app exists is fantastic"
au;1;What on earth are you people doing? Why does this not support the contact tracing API. That was released weeks ago!! This app is useless on iPhone in its current form. Pull your heads out!
au;3;I support the app and it’s purpose, but it has been interfering with other Bluetooth services on my phone to the point they stop working until I restart the device.
au;1;"After opening the app all Bluetooth devices will stop connecting.
The only way to fix it is to reboot the iPhone but once you reopen the app again the devices will stop connecting again."
us;5;Haven’t been sick since downloading the App. Must be working.
au;1;My app keeps deactivating and every few weeks I have to re submit my details. As I get an alert stating I have not activated it!  Not sure “how safe I feel “ with this constantly happening.
au;1;The app consistently disconnects other Bluetooth connected devices such as my Fitbit. The only way to reconnect the Fitbit is to turn Bluetooth off and on again, then the app disconnects the Fitbit again. Very frustrating.
au;3;I downloaded this app the first day and I have it running in the background 24/7.  However, we keep hearing it doesn’t work on iPhones unless it’s open on an unlocked phone.  Who walks around with an unlocked phone?  Glad to see the annoying daily reminder is gone.  I wondered if that was sent because the app was in the background and now somehow a fix has been found so it works that way.  But seeing so many comments about the notification makes me suspect it was stopped to avoid losing users.  Meanwhile apparently I may as well not have the app because I don’t leave my phone unlocked unless I’m using it, and if I’m using it the app is the background anyway - either way it’s not working apparently.  And the vast majority of close contacts I have are in my workplace, where phones are illegal. Honestly I only keep the app because the government threatened to hold off reopening places unless enough of us downloaded it. This my rating has dropped from 5 to 3 stars.
au;1;As soon as I have installed this app, my iPhone Bluetooth doesnt connect to my Apple Watch via Bluetooth... I then deleted the app and then the Bluetooth connection between the two worked again... please fix
au;1;With so many allowed to protest, clearly it’s no longer required.
au;4;"Great idea.
Thought that maybe app could generate a QRcode so that restaurant and cafes could scan it for faster information collection and ease of contact tracing. It would also negate the need for written personal information."
au;1;"It is stupid to spend so much producing this application, which hardly anyone will use. Rather then just enforcing masks in public like other countries. The only reason I can think for the existence of this app is, is that it is either:
  - Intended as a safety blanket for those getting ‘anxious’ because they lack any mental resilience and can’t handle just staying the hell at home.
  - Some high level government tech illiterate thought this was a good idea."
au;1;"After the protests on the weekend it is clear the government is no longer worried about COVID19.
Nor now am I. 
App deleted."
au;1;I gave this a one star for the memes
au;5;A helpful addition to fighting COVID-19. So the latest update 1.5 does that mean they are using the Apple code to help the iPhone work better?
au;2;I updated the app but every few days it says it’s not activated and I have to put my details in again and get the code to verify my details. I’m sick of it! I have no idea if it’s actually working or not!
au;4;I Have been using this App for a long while now and I am Proud to say I never thought how affective it is Even got warned when there was someone with the Virus near Me I love this app as a Idea and has really changed my Life.
in;1;When COVID SAFE App is installed and is in background ,other BLE based app is not working at all.But the same issue is not occurring with other COVID Based apps say Arogya Sethu etc. I observed this in first hand and it causes a “serious issue.”Please fix this asap.
au;5;I have no problem with this app on my iPhone X. It sits quietly in the background and hopefully does what’s required. I’m not worried about anyone tracking me. If the government thinks my life is that important that they need to track me, they should just ask, I can give them that anytime. This app is designed to help me and others. If I was scared of third parties gaining info off me, I wouldn’t own a smart phone and I would live in Alice springs.
au;4;This app is a fantastic idea and the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it doesn’t support Apple Watch. I work in a very large hotel where we have now welcomed back guests. I very rarely have my phone on me because I have a cellular Apple Watch. If I was to come into contact with someone it wouldn’t be recorded because I don’t have my phone and there app isn’t available for Apple Watch.
au;3;"I’ve got this app running all the time because I recognise the greater importance of it. But golly it’s annoying and I’ve come within a cat’s whisker of deleting it multiple times. In fact, I’m writing this review now to distract myself while the urge to delete it dies down.
Why? It entirely breaks the Bluetooth connection between Apple Watch and the phone. As a result;
- even though I have “block all unknown callers” enabled, Apple Watch rings every single time an unknown number calls and no record of the call appears in the recents section on the phone - iPhone has no idea the call occurred!!
- music playing, fitness tracking, auto-unlock, remote cancelling of alarms; none of it works from Apple Watch
- the watch battery drains faster because it’s constantly connecting directly to the mobile network even though my phone is less than a metre from it.
If you are an Apple Watch user this app is a difficult proposition, sadly."
au;3;"The June release still doesn’t support iOS 13.5 COVID-19 exposure logging which Apple & Google developed together to help the Bluetooth communication between devices and make sure logging occurs when the app isn’t running.

Update this app Aussie health dept!"
au;1;"A new update, but still not using the API, will test for 24 hours then remove if the watch stops auto connecting.

Add: now it won’t even uninstall, stays there as a blank icon."
au;5;My sister got tested for corona and we are still waiting for the results, but I really hope that the coronavirus Sensor on this app really does work because it says that she doesn’t have the virus but I guess we will just have to wait for the results to see if the app sensor is right!
au;1;"They’ve had another week to update this to use the Apple Exposure Logging API.
New update comes in and the government developers still have not done the one thing that will make this app do what they claim.
Uninstalled again 😟"
au;1;Disappointed that the govt is pushing this app but it’s effectively useless until it integrates with your phone properly.
au;1;Asks to register my details again every time I switch my phone on. Have reinstalled app, have hit the back key as per the app’s help page with same result. I only have the app begrudgingly because I work in hospitality. Others don’t have this issue so is it 6s iPhone only?
au;1;I do not expect other iPhone users to understand that for this to work they need to leave their phone unlocked and this app only open in the screen whenever in public spaces. This app needs to adopt Apple and Google’s Exposure Notification APIs because it is the only way this idea will ever practically work.
au;5;Suggestion for improvement not everyone remember to open the app when travelling its better to send notifications as soon as they leave particular location like home, office advising to open the app.
au;3;I truly hope this works as they say it will. Having a vulnerable partner I’m concerned to hear reports this not be working properly on my iPhone. I do know that my battery seems to drain a lot faster so I am hoping that’s an indication that it is collecting data. Keeping my fingers crossed.
au;1;I’m a little confused as this app hasn’t done anything, and when I go into the app nothing happens apart from the logo spinning, is this just my phone or is this how the app is supposed to work?
au;4;All in favour of the app but the Apple Watch problem of the watch being unable to connect to the iPhone (using bluetooth) while the COVIDSafe app is running must solved. Happens irregularly but often enough to be a problem. There are quite a few people reporting the same problem on forums and the like.
au;1;"While the app is thoughtful and we should all play our part , it’s been almost a month and this app break Bluetooth functionality on iPhone period. Apple Watch , Bluetooth headphones do not sync up properly . Had to Pair and re- pair my watch every time this app launches ! 

Fix it or you will loose momentum in getting people to use this app in Australia ."
au;1;why not use iOS 13.5 Covid 19 api

au;1;This app is still not working on iPhone. I am unable to turn on exposure logging in my settings. Apple says this is not an authorised app and tells me to uninstall it.  This app is not doing what it says it should be doing.   If you have iPhone. Make sure you have the latest iOS 13.5.  In settings. Privacy. Bluetooth. Turn on exposure logging will be at the top. If you can’t turn it on the app is NOT working.
au;1;The app did not use the latest iOS COVID-19 api
au;4;Should work on the Apple Watch too
au;1;"Just letting everyone know Bill Gates loves you all and will soon have a vaccine.
How do i know this? Well he wears a pink sweater"
au;3;I have had the app open on my phone for days but I just got a notice to say it has not been active. When I checked it was still open. Is this a bug? How do I know if it’s working or not?
au;1;"More government rubbish.
Destroys my battery life, has continual nags about running it, interferes with my apple watch and has only ever been used by the health dept. once. Yes once 😂
What a joke. They told us restrictions would be eased if people downloaded it. LIES LIES LIES.
The coders need to slap each other in the face for writing such cr@p.

Deleted 0*"
au;2;This app has caused my Apple Watch to disconnect from my iPhone constantly. The only way to reconnect is by turning Bluetooth off and on. Since deleting the app haven’t had an issue.
au;3;App was fine when first released however have recently found it interferes with Fitbit linking when operating. Have to constantly disconnect app to allow other devices to sync. Not as convinced as once was that the app is worth persisting with. Waiting to see if next update addresses Bluetooth on iPhone otherwise will only turn on when I remember.
au;1;"This app needs to be updated to use the Exposure Notification API urgently. If it is not updated soon, everyone will start deleting it and it will be hard to rebuild trust to download it.
The Apple Watch disconnection bug is a frustration and isn’t included in the COVIDsafe help page as a known bug despite being noticed by users 10 days ago. All it says is “Apple Watch not supported” which is a different statement altogether."
au;4;I know of other people who have deleted this app because every day at least once it sends you a reminder to keep Bluetooth on! This needs to stop it’s annoying - I am trying to do the right thing but I’m also on the verge of deleting the app
au;1;Waiting for gov to update.
au;1;I mean, let’s be honest, this is a pretty basic app and yet they can’t make it work as it is supposed to work. Why on earth you don’t remember I’ve already registered? I own an iPhone 6s with the latest iOS. Why do I have to re-register every single time I start the app? Come on, it shouldn’t be too hard.
au;3;This app gives Bluetooth issue, lots of disconnection and causes apple watch battery drain.
au;1;"It interferes with other apps I’m using at the same time & flattens the battery within two hours. 

Not very satisfactory."
au;5;Great idea for keeping this virus away when returning to business. Early prevention and intervention can help wider community.
au;3;I understand the government would like to keep the community and the citizen safe hence why I have downloaded it. But I hate getting daily notification from the app, pretty annoying if you asked me. Like I get it the Bluetooth needs to be on but I don’t need a daily reminder.
au;3;"Causes a couple of problems that only surfaced when I started going back to the office. 

1. It prevents the Bluetooth hands free in my car from working. I cannot answer incoming calls or play music though BT.

2. If I forget to minimise the app after checking active, it keeps the screen active and rapidly drains the battery.

I’ll persist with it for now."
au;2;"It has altered the security of my iPhone and when I have the app open, the iPhone doesn’t auto screen lock. 

Urgent, please fix this quickly!!!"
au;1;No . This is poo
au;1;Great idea for an app, if only it worked when it’s closed
au;2;"My thoughts on this app have gone way down; this is disconnecting my Apple Watch Series 4 way too much, about once every day; draining my battery (iPhone 11). I have heard Apple has released an API that could be used with this app, I feel like that is very necessary right now to work better with iPhones. I’m starting to wonder if the benefits are even worth it anymore."
au;2;The app is frequently interrupting connection with my Apple Watch and wireless headphones.
au;1;Somehow the Bluetooth emissions take over and eliminate the Bluetooth sound system. Turn off the app and it comes back.
au;2;Why do I have to keep re-registering all the time? Obviously it's not really doing it's job..
au;1;Widget - to automate its function running in the background, instead of manually opening the app most people tendency to forget.
au;2;I would of given 5 stars but I am not happy it is not compatible with Apple Watch!
au;1;Every time I open the app to make sure it’s running when I leave the house, the registration screen comes up!!! So frustrating!! If you want us to use this app then make it work or it will be deleted!!!
au;1;After updating to 13.5, If I go to privacy and into COVID-19 feature it won’t recognise to set it on and it won’t recognise the COVID-19 app.
au;1;"Does this app work?
How do you know if it’s working when it doesn’t give you any feedback?
How much did the developer get for creating such rubbish."
au;2;Would love to run this app, but by half way through the day it’s killed the Bluetooth connection between my Apple Watch and my iPhone.
au;1;"This app does not work, it does not (it cannot) communicate with Bluetooth, unless your iPhone is unlocked and this app is running in the foreground. The Bluetooth security of an iPhone simply does not allow it to connect to another phone if your iPhone is locked or you are running another app.

No one is going to walk around with their iPhone unlocked, nor are they going to make sure this app is running into the foreground all the time. Are you doing this? If not the app is doing nothing.

Lock your iPhone screen - the app stops working.
Use another app, make a call, send a message, play a game, do anything else - the app stops working.

They must implement the new Apple-Google APIs which have recently been published with iOS 13.5 for it to work, securely and privately in the background, and until they do this the app literally does nothing. Switzerland are the first (and currently only) country to have done this to date.

Anyone who thinks this app will do anything otherwise is being fooled. It is not making you safe, it is not making anyone with an iPhone safe, and it is being greatly misrepresented by the government and its app developers."
au;1;"When on, my I-watch  bluetooth connection is lost, reducing its functionality, and decreasing battery life.
My solution, i have turned off the app. I want my watch to function normally.
Happy to turn the app back on when the conflict with bluetooth is solved."
au;1;"Seemed great
But then updates and you have to re-register
And then updates and now it will no longer accept my mobile number. After registering twice, it now fails. 
Please check and fix as I am now back at work. 
Thanks"
au;2;Firstly I don’t want the government know where I’m goin so I’m not downloading this HELL NO
au;1;The radiation from this app gave me coronavirus. Not happy bob not happy.
au;3;I keep getting notifications reminding me to keep Bluetooth on, then when I open the app it says it is active? I don’t turn Bluetooth off. I’m just going to turn off notifications for the app. But if you want people to download it, don’t annoy them with unnecessary notifications.
au;2;"I reinstalled the app after iOS 13.5 came out thinking it would support the more private exposure logging system Apple & Google developed but it doesn’t. Do not install.

Government agencies are already abusing warrantless access to our metadata and trying to weaken encryption; I don’t think we should trust them with more data.

Let’s maintain social distance to slow the spread of COVID-19 AND maintain vigilance to slow the spread of government overreach."
au;3;Apple released a core OS function for COVID-19 exposure notifications which will allow apps like this to function better. Why even in the latest version is it not being leveraged?
au;1;The fact that you have to keep the app open before loving the screen makes impractical.  You go out feeling somewhat safe thinking that app is collecting important information about who you come into contact with only to find out that is was not even working.  Due to the known limitations of the iPhone’s iOS security, they needed to have waited until the Apple/Google API was released which would enable contact tracing to occur even when the app was not open.  This current app will give everyone a false sense of security.
au;3;iOS 13.5 introduced iOS level support for exposure notifications, this would be 100% more functional and reliable if it supported that API.
au;5;It may encourage more people to download this app, if the number of people downloading the COVIDSafe app is updated and published regularly in websites and apps that deal with the coronavirus.
au;4;Why not integrate with Apple API? Will work much better and no need to run app
au;1;Not compatible with the iOS 13.5 COVID-19 Exposure logging api.
au;1;"Cve-2020-12860 and cve-2020-12856 need to be felt with before anyone should install this app.
The source code clearly needs to be published for independent review.

Please consider redesigning the app to implement the APIs made available by Apple for contact tracing."
au;2;"Great idea but needs more. 

• Should be able to run in background on iOS

• Should be able to mark your home so it will send push notifications if you leave your home. 

• Should have a watch app.

EDIT: May 26 - still no update. This will be fixed after the pandemic has passed."
au;4;"I understand the importance of the app and am comfortable with the privacy precautions even though I would agree there are definitely concerns about data collection. For the moment though I think it’s an important public health and safety tool in the current situation. 

When I downloaded it I assumed it would have an option to run in the background if allowed so I didn’t have to have it open all the time. This doesn’t seem to be the case but I don’t mind that too much, I just have to keep remembering to open it again. 

However, the main issue is that every time I open it or even if it’s been open for a while it seems to go inactive and makes me sign up and reactivate again which is very impractical and inefficient. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Otherwise it seems to work fine."
au;3;It is still doing the daily notifications after the upgrade. So annoying
au;4;"I have downloaded and installed this app the day it was released, notifications are on obviously to let me know if I become in contact with someone that tests positive. Because of this, I am also getting constant reminders to keep my Bluetooth switched on which I am, these reminders are nothing but an annoyance. 

Stop sending repeated messages to users that are using the app correctly."
au;3;Other than the app saying it’s active and the bugs it causes I have no way of knowing if it is working. It’s a great idea and it’s unfortunate that we need it but it would be good to see some of the bugs fixed like the interference and connection issues with Bluetooth devices like my Apple Watch, headphones and car. I have tested and the issues only occur when this app is running.
au;2;"I like the simple design and I appreciate the existence of this app. But it is almost useless on iPhones in its current form.

It needs to be open right now at all times to track contacts. Literally nobody is keeping the app open when they leave the house as this is incredibly impractical for the user.

Apple’s API allows the phone to constantly be tracking Bluetooth contacts. This would allow the app to work properly. The developers should have waited for the proper Apple API to make the app, but since it’s made, now the app needs to be updated to the proper Apple API.

Until it’s updated it’s near useless. It’s only been used to track a coronavirus patient once in the entire country."
au;2;Is not yet compatible with Apple & Google’s privacy-preserving exposure tracing API.
au;3;Think it’s better to start using Apple’s implementation. Getting messages about this app not being activated for more than 48 hours whilst I have never closed the app, not rebooted phone etc. Should just stay active. Set and forget.
au;1;It is failing to comply with Apple Bluetooth standards which will make your iPhone at risk such as loss of data, no wonder Pauline Hanson, didn’t install the app, the app is made to make us scared that this virus is never going away, stay safe, this app won’t protected us from the virus, only hand washing and self isolation is the key, to survive,.
au;1;"I was going to wait until the source code was published, but since this government feels they do not have to earn our trust (despite raiding legitimate journalists) I decided to put protecting the community above ensuring my rights were not being compromised. 

Unfortunately the app designers must be sleep deprived or something. They ask for an Australian mobile number but start it with the international prefix +61! Why? If it’s an Australian number the international dialing prefix just creates confusion.

Do you include the leading 0? I would think not, but it wont accept my number without the leading 0... but wait... it also wont accept it with the leading 0. So this app wont work for me. There is nothing special about my number. Did this app get any testing before it was released? Surely I am not the only one experiencing this bug?"
au;1;It’s a good idea but it works horribly and I dont really want to give the government accurate location tracking of me also it drains your phone battery so fast and if you r smart about what you do it isn’t really necessary
au;2;Why have the developers not adopted the universal API that Apple added in iOS 13.5 to ensure exposure logging works correctly on iphones as right now it only works in limited scenarios.
au;5;I think COVIDSafe is a great app as it protects you from COVID-. 19
au;1;"Edit: latest version break all other Bluetooth device connected to your iPhone. Just how incompetent are these clowns.

Please delete all source code and use Apple’s COVID exposure API instead.

All your location data are uploaded to central server, there’s no anonymity, there’s no privacy protection. Remember when people opting out MyHealth in large numbers because there’s no guarantee third party will not have access to the data.

We need a contract tracing app that do the job while protecting individual’s privacy, this isn’t it."
au;1;iOS 13.5 includes a contact tracing API. This app in its current form is useless, unless it takes advantage of the new API.
au;3;Happy to use the app. Hopefully the next iteration will allow it to run in the background.
au;4;I downloaded the app for the greater good and do not referent as we as Australians should be proud how we have handled this outbreak. However the Bluetooth is very intrusive. I cannot listen to music through my AirPods as it either drops the connection or makes it unlistenable. And also the app will disconnect my connection to my Apple Watch. Also I need to get the government to get on board with Apple’s COVID api as having my phone unlocked and the app open drains battery and is not secure at all.
au;1;It’s the third time now I’ve had to register myself when I open the app. It’s not saving my profile on my phone it seems
au;2;Have deleted 2 different versions of this app now. Basically, the Bluetooth exposure tracking causes my fitbit not to sync, or even be seen by my phone. Even on iOS 13.5.  At least the latest version seemed to not shutdown in the background like previous versions. Won’t be installing again.
au;1;1 star for not using the baked in API provided by google and apple. Would not trust this government with my fecal matter let alone any data. I tried and deleted the app. Developer is lazy and government is untrustworthy.
au;1;"I downloaded ASAP but now read the iphone app fails.
I was doubtful of that claim until I just checked that it was active during today’s meetings and saw the app was unable to access Bluetooth
I checked settings and all correct. 
Reopened app and it was finally active but not until my meetings were over😳"
au;1;Was shocked to discover that my recent big problems with my Apple watch were caused by having this app running in background. When I switch off CovidSafe bluetooth, the watch finally works again. Thus app MUST adopt Apple/Google system. I cannot afford to junk my watch just for the sake of this app.
au;1;My Bluetooth is always on, but I’m constantly getting notifications to turn my Bluetooth on.
au;1;"The app has been installed and running (supposedly) in the background since it was first released. I make sure that I don’t have many other apps running in the background (maybe one other), yet I get a message saying that it’s not working. 
What a disgraceful con being run by the federal government. This app needs to run without issue - no wonder no one trusts them with technology."
au;2;"Update the app using the new Exposure Notification API or I’m uninstalling this as it’s pointless otherwise...

There is no excuse to not have a new version out: developers have had access to this API for weeks."
au;2;Conflicts with other devices that use Bluetooth with my iPhone ie knocks out my watch and AirPods connection and kind of causes havoc in general.
au;1;Can’t access Bluetooth a complete waste of time at the moment. Using iPhone 6s update your app to include
au;1;What can you lose by adopting Apple/Google’s API. I for one would prefer Better battery life and better efficiency...
au;1;I don’t want to open the app every five seconds, I’ve deleted the app and my data. Why would you not use the API developed by the people who write the operating system? Are you stupid?
au;1;I ain’t downloading it till you guys use Google/Apples CoVid API so we have extra protection
au;1;Bluetooth won’t play through any devices since installing app even though it shows them as connected 🤬
au;5;The app and legislated protections to our privacy are a great start. Please update with the Covid-19 Exposure Notification APIs from Apple and Google to improve effectiveness and privacy.
au;1;"I want  to support this , but I actually need my phone to work .. 
is it just me ? Since installing this it destroys my phone life, and I get lots of messages re Bluetooth not being on when it is on"
au;1;TRASH
au;5;Yep
au;1;I’ve got nothing against the concept of the app but it was rushed out too soon. Exposure Notification API was released as part of iOS 13.5 today which provides a better solution. I’ll reinstall the app when they upgrade it.
au;2;Great idea of the app! But it keeps asking me to turn my Bluetooth on...when it is on. I have to turn it off then on again for the app to be happy. A little annoying because then sometimes it isn’t actually on and I’m unaware.
au;1;"If this is meant to be the answer to opening up Australia, then why is it so buggy and useless on iOS?!

Does NOT work with the latest iOS that has COVID-19 exposure logging, it does not come up as an authorised app. 

Frequently turns off and goes back to initiation registration screen.  

I have a relatively new iPhone and latest iOS, so I can only image the potential issues on older phones. If it means that we have to keep remembering to open the app every time we go near people, that’s so impractical and in reality frequently forgotten and likely not going to happen!

The PM lauded it as a measure to opening up the country- now the developers need to get it to live up to the hype. I’m all for this to work! Let’s hope for a great update to this app!!"
au;3;This morning Apple released iOS 13.5 that features the new Exposure Notification API. In order to greatly increase the usefulness of this app, it needs to use this API to protect users privacy and allow the app to run in the background.
au;1;"Every day, a a daily Notification just to let you know that the app is active and no further action is required. 

Then STOP the incessant notification."
au;5;This is my favorite app. It is great. I love it.
au;5;Apple just released 13.5 to the public this morning to the world and it has its own integrated COVID-19 so it can work with our Aussie app. Hurry up and released an Update. Thank you!!
au;3;This app needs to give feedback when it collects data. Either an optional Ping noise, or allow you to see a table of date stamped data. Otherwise you get the feeling it’s not working

Is 👍 with that ok 👍 from Kristin"
au;1;False security blanket with a dash of invasion of privacy
au;1;Need to get this thing working as soon as it is downloaded. No point in needing it open and running in the background. Sort it out. We need this to work well
au;2;The app interfered with my other Bluetooth devices if left running in background for more than an hour. It disconnected wireless headphones several times. It unpaired Apple Watch entirely that I had to reset and re-pair my watch.
au;5;Runs quietly in the background, a good public health initiative.
au;2;"could you not keep it all anonymous?
Everyone gets a unique identifier, and the app keeps 20 days of contact with other identifiers. Then when someone gets a positive result they also get given an access code that only works once so prankers can’t pretend they have it to scare others. You punch that code in and if it comes up yes, the alert goes out to your buddy phones. 
Maybe to get people to admit they have it, and get more ppl to download the app you don’t even tell them the result but their code gives them the result.
Just spit balling. Gov stuffed up with mygov and census. So I’m hesitantly caving."
au;5;"I am a doctor- a GP
The vast consensus of Australian GPs in this forum (currently more than 7000 members) agree that we should download this app. So please go ahead and keep us all safe. 

If we can suppress this deadly virus we can breathe easy and life can go back to near normal again."
au;1;The government is stalking you just like Life360 so yep, don't download this.
au;4;Pls don’t keep reminding me to keep the app on and Bluetooth on. It’s repetitive. I’m very happy to help and would like to keep notifications on in case something important needs to be communicated. But every two days or so is a bit much.
au;3;For times when out exercising & don’t have iPhone but record my activity on Apple Watch it would be great to have this app on the watch. Especially now that outdoor group exercise is allowed for groups 10 & under.
au;1;I think this is a great idea, it’s really important for people to download it. However, I’ve downloaded it twice and each time it has messed with my Bluetooth devices. This needs to be fixed!
au;1;Flattens battery in a few hours.
au;2;Unable to connect to my Apple Watch over Bluetooth after downloading the app. Can be fixed by toggling Bluetooth on/off and reconnecting daily. Very frustrating.
au;3;Downloaded the app, open it when I’m out plying golf, drains the battery over 18 holes. Do I assume contact tracing can happen by tracking back through bookings and only use it when I’m in a situation where contact tracing is more difficult?
au;1;Styiped thing it is a kid hear don’t download it
au;2;All good but enough already with the motivational and self-aggrandising messages it continuously and continuously sends out. I had to turn notifications off to shut the thing up. That probably means I won’t get a notification if I come close to a risky patient. Doh!
au;1;Tried to join.  Gave phone number error. Both wifi and Bluetooth were active.
au;1;It does not give the user anything. If it reported on map where people had been detected as having the virus in real time. People could check it and self isolate if they felt they were at risk. The model it uses should be distributed not centralised for more people to be happy downloading it. The government needs to work in with apple and google to help develop a decentralised app to nationalise and the globalise the effort. People coming from abroad are the biggest risk to Australia. A global app means that people from abroad are automatically monitored and part of the effort.
au;3;"Current version makes emails crash on iPhone.
Happy to help the world but not if it breaks my phone."
au;4;I have no issues with having the app, no worries at all. What bugs me though is that on my iPhone 11 I Bluetooth to a sound system or headset and play Spotify all day while I work. Every time this pings a Covid App Bluetooth handshake signal, whether in wifi or SIM it stops Spotify briefly. I thought it might be Spotify, but if I swap to another device without this app I don’t get the glitch. An annoying side effect, really.
au;1;App interferes with Bluetooth connection to other devices. My Phone now disconnects my Apple Watch multiple times a day. Only by turning Bluetooth on and off can I reconnect my watch.
au;3;Does it really work in the background. If not then it is of little use as we have other app in use in the foreground like Runkeeper, email etc?
au;5;Really impressed, I downloaded the app and haven’t caught the virus. Amazing how an app can do that.
au;1;Covid hoax.
au;2;Derails other Bluetooth devices. Had to uninstall the app. Will reinstall if they fix this.
au;1;"For a multicultural country with immigrants from all over the world it is exceedingly bone headed to have this app restricted to the Australian App Store. My wife and I have lived here for 7 years and still have US apple IDs so it took a lot of messing around to download this. 

Thing of the number of international student wants, temporary migrants and people born overseas who need this app to be as simple to download as possible."
au;1;The app sends a daily push notification mentioning putting the app into an internal “power saving mode”, which isn’t present on the Australian version of this app. Did no one review the code they cloned from Singapore?
au;2;"The idea is great but execution is poor. 

The power use is crazy and it slows down all other apps in use. As taxi driver I need my phone active and power not getting drained like I live streaming. I can’t even use my google maps while this is running as they lag way to much to be any use which only happens while this app running.

Maybe it’s because I on older iPhone but I don’t get why such basic app is a bigger power hog than running live stream vids."
au;2;It caused my type one diabetes blood sugar monitoring app dexcom’s Bluetooth signal to drop out and didn’t alert me to my dangerous low blood sugar event. As soon as I deleted the app after hours of tying to get the signal back it magically reappeared. Be cautious CGM users!
au;4;Developers take note: when users download your app updates, the app is automatically closed. Unless people remember to open it, it stays closed and is then useless. So please reduce the frequency of your tweaks.
au;1;I’ve had to re download this a number of times now - I’ll sign up and enter all my info and it will be fine for a day or two then I’ll be booted out and asked to submit all my info again! I’ve just uninstalled. What use is it if it doesn’t work!?
au;5;They need to advertise how it works on TV more. Unfortunately there are still many people out there who think it’s tracks them and they don’t want the ‘government’ to have their personal details. They need a 1 minute commercial on tv that explains what it does and doesn’t do. Ignorance is letting us down.... come on Australia download and use it!!!
au;4;"In addition to my previous reviews below, I understand that Apple don’t approve apps that utilise undocumented/private APIs, but I would have thought that, given the current circumstances, they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS. This would be particularly important for devices that won’t receive iOS 13.4.5/13.5 and therefore won’t receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic.

Update to my previous review: I’ve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image, it simply wasn’t obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed. Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow, particularly when the app is unable to function, or better yet, the part of the screen containing the tick/crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function.

In addition to my previous review below, I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions, Bluetooth disabled, etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also, the updated version of the app displays a green image, which is a universally understood indication that something is working, even if the app is unable to function, at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function.

Previous review:
Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app, in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes, therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal."
au;3;"Shareing a troubleshooting experience with a friend who tried to install this. 

Following the instructions in the app, you are instructed to register with your Full name in the format  (first, last)  eg Fred, Smith   If you do this, the app will not successfully register later. However you wont know this at the time. It will simply tell you at the next step that your phone number is incorrect and that you must enter an Australian phone number. 
At that point it further tells you to enter your mobile number in international format beginning +61 ... which should normally mean removing the leading zero. Entering your number in either format and submitting the PIN request you get a message that there is an error verifying your phone number. But this is because of the name error.

Registration fails until you 1) remove the comma you are told to add in your name, and 2) add the zero you are told to leave out of your mobile number.

I wonder how many haven’t completed registration because of following the instructions carefully?"
au;5;As above lol
au;4;Great App to keep us all safe. Would be even better if it could be used on Apple Watch . Here’s hoping this will come
au;1;"Every single day the app tells me to register even though I already have done so correctly, as well as telling me to have my Bluetooth on — it is on all the time,  I dislike being told to do things I already have done.  If I want pointless nagging about things - I would get back with my ex!  I do not watch / listen to annoying ads on the tv / radio (I change stations or watch a DVD.). 
There is no where on the app to send feedback about this annoyance.  I am sure that if I sent e-mails daily to the Prime Minister berating him, he would have police (& possibly ASIO) on my doorstep telling my to cease.  Well...This constant berating to do turn the Bluetooth on, to register, to have the app, has now resulted in me ceasing this app.  I am deleting it from my iPad and iPhone.  I would rather spend an extra six months in lock down than put up with another day of reminders."
au;5;"Deleted the COVIDSafe app to protest against the mandatory flu vaccination of the NRL players.

While I believe that vaccines have their merits, they are not as safe as made out by the mainstream media.

I vehemently oppose mandatory vaccination for multiple reasons. Most importantly, mandatory vaccination leads to reduced responsibility for vaccine manufacturers. Also, mandatory vaccination forces the individual to accept all the risks while removing the right to compensation except in cases of blatant culpability.

I am surprised that it isn’t mandatory to get a clean bill of health immediately prior to each vaccination. This way reactions would have to be attributed to either the vaccine or to an examination error. Either way an investigation would have to be carried out in every case of an adverse reaction."
au;5;Works fine on iphonexsmax
au;1;"App will not send the pin to my mobile number, cannot reactivate the app on my iPhone that up until now, has not had any problems.
Trying to do the right thing however when the app server appears to be faulting it is getting more and more difficult to maintain the app use that is constantly draining my phone battery.
Please URGENTLY resolve the app issue!!
Note - not a user error, I have wifi off, have not had issues up until today with using the app."
au;5;Despite all the misinformation going around about COVIDSafe, I have no doubt this is the most effective way for each of us to contribute to stopping the spread and going back to normal. Join the fight and help our health authorities trace and contain future breakouts.
au;1;Not received the sms, tried several times.  Not much use if the front door to the app is locked 😆
au;1;The German and Italian tracing apps already work in the background mode for iOS. Come on Australian Government do your part and use the Apple API.
au;5;Can’t understand the fuss about this. People download most apps without a thought and they track you much more than this one can.
au;5;Come on Aussie! Download this protector 😉
au;4;First of all, if this app helps us track and trace I’m for it. One way it could possibly be improved is if there was a way of including a daily count of how many handshakes had happened. I think It would be useful for people to know how often it has occurred so they can moderate their behaviour.
au;1;Worked initially, but now won't open at all.
au;5;"Happy to install it and happy to know if we come in contact with someone who has virus.
If only everyone was as sensible as us. Too many people spreading dangerous misinformed conspiracy theories.
Happy to be sensible and not paranoid ❤️😇"
au;1;Requires a daily or Bi-daily login where you need to re-enter your details again. How is this tracking me if I’m having to log in all the time. waste of time - DELETED off our devices. So much for set and forget!!!
au;1;I can’t get the app to work. I have iPhone 6plus. It’s telling me I need Bluetooth on but it IS on. I can’t see why it’s not working. Notifications are on too. Can’t figure this out b
au;1;I have to re-enter my details every day. What’s the point in even having the app if my details aren’t reliably stored?
au;1;Can’t verify my mobile number.... what else to say....
au;4;"I have today uploaded the latest COVID19 Safe App on my iPhone 5 - it was working fine before this update - but now the screen won't stay open as the front screen and doesn't appear to me to be operating.
I could not find any where else to record request for technical support for this app"
au;5;Hi there, great App thank you! Can you please create an Apple Watch version so I can turn it on and not worry about whether I have my phone with me or not when I am out. Thank you 🙏
au;1;Since the upgrade to version 1.02 this app no longer works on my iPhone 5. Very disappointing as I'm sure that this could have been avoided by the developers and Apple.
au;1;I had to delete COVIDSafe app as it would not open this morning & now I can’t re-register.  Stuck. I was one of the first Australians to download it too! Will try after my phone is updated to latest from Apple sent overnight.
au;5;Must be downloaded to save our lives and loved ones
au;1;Its asking me to register again and again
au;4;Just wondering if this works on my Apple Watch as it doesn’t appear to show the app on there
au;1;Latest version of 32 bit COVIDSafe app (1.2) does not work with iOS 10.3.4 (14G61) on iPhone 5. It crashes upon starting up. Please fix this problem ASAP and perform full app testing on latest supported versions of iOS on all iPhones to ensure proper working order.
au;1;I was expecting to have information relating to where those confirmed cases are. But this app said nothing about that. Totally useless.
au;3;I hope they can improve battery drain. My phone used to last for 2 days on full charge prior to downloading the app and now i can only get 20hours out of one full charge.
au;3;I registered using the app and activated, left it active in the background... just happened to click on the app to see if there was any information being shared regarding local take up and I found that it requested me to register again. So now I’m not sure whether I’ve been contributing to my own safety and that of others around me?
au;4;The app is an absolutely great idea and hope everyone downloads it. The only issue I have is you have to turn it on, why cannot it not always be on even if the app is closed, if google can always track me (by choice) why can this app not just work and make it safer for all as no forgetting to turn it on.
au;2;Embrace it! Understand the concerns about the lack of control especially for legality’s sake, but right now the framework developed by Apple and Google is far more powerful and effective than the COVIDSAFE app. I can confirm with a simple Bluetooth listener that the app will not work on an iPhone 11 with the screen locked unless the app was opened and allowed to refresh its processes within the 60mins. This needs to be fixed.... iPhone users have a completely unusable app right now and if there are any claims counter this it simply isn’t true! We need the Aus Gov to embrace the new API and just get the app working properly.
au;4;Latest update won't let me open app keeps closing continuously tried uninstalling it reinstalling still closes
au;3;"I realise that until Apple and Google release their contract tracing API the only way for COVIDSafe to work is to remain the active app. But sending a daily reminder notification in the morning will quickly make non-technical users ignore/discard notifications from this app.

I am assuming COVIDSafe will use Apple's contact tracing API, otherwise I don't know many iPhone users who will regularly use the app. If this is the case, please use notifications sparingly at the moment because they will become critical in the future. Notifications should only be used to alert you to possible exposure that requires  an immediate test.

Please don't make us numb to notifications before the real contact tracing capability exists!"
au;3;My husband has an older iPhone. It can’t update to the latest iOS and it can’t install the COVIDSafe app
au;5;I downloaded this app when it was launched and have since then updated it to the latest version. I feel I am doing something great to stop the spreading of this virus. Have never felt that this app is going to expose my privacy when there lot more apps and social media where privacy is out of the window. Good to use the technology to keep the bad virus at bay.
au;5;The app is for the benefit of all !  Let us be proactive, use our foresight to guide us and not let hindsight be our teacher.  Let us all work together to stop the spread of the virus and return to the life we enjoy. Let not selfish motives stop you from sharing your cooperation. If you have nothing to hide then there is really no excuse for you not to download it!
au;3;"The idea and everything behind the app is great.
Getting notifications every day is annoying and I have turned off the notifications for the app. 
Only sending notifications if it’s important would be a great upgrade.
There is a global pandemic, I’m not going to wake up and forget that so please stop with the notifications."
au;3;On iPhones, does the app actually work in the background or when my screen is locked? I often have to log in multiple times, which makes me think it doesn’t or at least not consistently. That seems counterproductive and not shielding me or those around me. It needs a fix pronto. Otherwise, super easy to use.
au;1;I’m onto my 6th registration for this App on my iPhone (2 post “bug fix” upgrade last week). And yes, I am leaving it open/running in the background with Bluetooth on. Lucky the government is not relying on data from the App for anything important....🤪
au;1;Be careful ♡
au;5;I feel really strongly that everyone should download this app. Such an easy way that we can contribute to easing social distancing restrictions and tracing positive cases. Simple setup too!
au;3;I downloaded the app the day it came out and I support it 100% but I’m finding that keeping the app running and requiring Bluetooth is draining my battery to the point where I’m only getting half a day’s use (iPhone X). I only leave the house for work but when I’m at work I have to turn off the app and Bluetooth or I drain my battery, defeating the purpose of having the app.
au;1;App was simple to set up but STOP sending me notifications to keep the app running and Bluetooth on. I KNOW! Going to delete the app as I’m sick to death of hear repetitive useless notifications.
au;3;So I’m not sure how to review this, there’s nothing to show the user what’s happening. Just for the innovation of this to track diseases spread it gets 3 stars from me, can be really helpful. However need to show status, what’s happening? What’s the app doing? What information is it collecting? Also give user control setting what personal information is stored. Also every once in a while it gives an alert “check if coronasafe app is active”, I’m sure this can be automated to check if it is active or not and only give alert if it’s not. Also run in the background to conserve power. But has a lot of potential.
au;5;"This is a really great initiative and very easy to use app. 
I was wondering if a similar app can be launched for the apple watch for people exercising outdoors."
au;5;"Some people appear to believe the app must remain active on the screen in order for it to work. Just open the app after you've registered and leave it running in the background. You can use other apps without issue. You'll forget it is even there.

As annoying as the morning notifications is just be assured it is to remind you to check if it is still open in the background and active. I don't always check each morning, and neither do you, just make sure it is open in the background every so often. No big deal."
au;5;was the only notification i received on my birthday. thank you covidsafe
au;3;"I am very supportive of this app but it is draining my battery every day and I got caught short with no charge. 

I have tried stopping in t and then putting back on when I left the house but found that I kept forgetting to start it each time so have been leaving running."
au;5;Easy to set up and it just works. Everyone should be downloading this.
au;4;The app currently says it’s not active if notifications are turned off. My understanding was that the app itself won’t notify if any close contact with confirmed cases however that a phone call would still be the method of notification. I’m receiving daily notifications from the app that are annoying. I would hope these notifications are minimised OR the app is ‘active’ without notifications being turned on. Happy to have the app running on my phone, but not happy to have frequent unwarranted notifications
au;1;Every time I open the app after 20 minutes of the app being in the background the app needs to restart. It’s useless. I’m certainly not going to keep the app running in the foreground to make sure it works properly. And no, I’m not using low power mode. The app is just poorly implemented. ☹️
au;5;"For those saying this is another way the government can track you. Seriously, grow up. You install it and it does not ask you anything about using location.
If you are concerned about your data, delete it.

If you still think that this can be used to track you. Then, you conspiracy theory nut cases better do a Google search on what Metadata is.  If you've read this far on my review, my weird tin foil hat wearing loo eyeing, what the hell are you using an electronic internet connected device for?

Aren't you being tracked right now? Better go outside and get some sunshine. But not too much, don't want those satellites tracking you. LOL."
au;1;Doesn’t work in the background, which is how we were told it would work.  Endless notifications reminding me to use it - but none of them mention that the app needs be be running in the foreground of an unlocked phone to work.  I downloaded this because I decided the greater good was worth the risk, but it seems I’ve been running nothing but a useless app in the background for data for no reason. Get this fixed!
au;5;THANK YOU ! For looking after Australians & Our Aussie business’s.. & other Global countries.... AWESOME JOB Well done!!!STAY SAFE !
au;5;I have no objection to using the Covidsafe app on my phone, but why is there no Apple Watch app? I generally wear my watch when out and about more so than carrying my phone.
au;2;I have had this app a week and it has asked me 4 times to login, requiring a six digit pin being sent to my phone...4 times??
au;5;Dnejdjd did so jdbs
au;2;"Hey 
Believe in the idea of the app!
This app made all my other Bluetooth devices connect to the phone stop working.
I tried it on three different days and times, it’s 100% this app.
Also I can’t find a way to tell the app developer other than this review?!?? Such a important time for This app and they fail to open communication"
au;2;I downloaded app and I am for the cause and love the idea but wow MASSIVE battery drain. After testing over a week on and off I can confirm the app uses huge amounts of resources. This needs to be fixed and then I’ll be on board.
au;5;Get behind this app and help save lives.
au;1;Every 3-7 days this app asks me to register again.
au;4;I use Bluetooth to connect to my hearing aid on my iPhone.  Does this limit the effectiveness of this app?
au;1;For an app that is so important one would think alerts for updates would be sent to users to ensure all users are using the latest version. But no, nothing. Another example of the inept inception of this tool by the developer and the government.
au;4;No issues installing or running since day 1 of release. Please though stop the daily reminder that the app is running when I have never closed it
au;2;The constant notifications are making me want to delete the app. It’s open. It’s running in the background. No, I cannot leave my phone unlocked 24-7. If those are the requirements for it to work, you need to build a better app.
au;4;I understand it needs Bluetooth to work. I don’t understand why I need to be reminded of this daily. Daily reminders are not needed, twice a week would be great. It seems to work fine apart from that.
au;2;"Doesn’t work at all on iOS?
Has anybody read the news."
au;1;D
au;4;It would be helpful if users can set their own time to remind us to use the app. Some of us start our day at 6 or 7 am, so a reminder at 9 am is a few hours too late.
au;1;"I consider this app could be really helpful in the battle against the the spread.
But if the user needs to keep the app running in foreground it becomes useless."
au;1;"I dunno who the idiots were who wrote this app were are, but they’re absolute morons!

The fact that this app doesn’t even work unless it’s always open in the foreground and doesn’t run in the background like basically the majority of all apps designed for iOS just goes to show just how stupid the government’s developers have become; not to mention it’s a serious breach in in user privacy and uses so much of a device’s resources that your device needs to be charged every few hours is a joke!

Well done to the government for making yourselves look like complete idiots, deleted this app; I’ll trust my common sense over this thing..."
au;3;"After testing the latest update, I have found that it is, at very least, on a technical level, functional. 
It still unnecessarily stores user data on a server, uses keys which are not truly anonymous, and transmits your device model publicly. 
Once decentralised key exchange replaces the current system, either by an independent update, or by the implementation of the system in production by Apple and Google, I will update this to five stars. 
For the time being, I would also like an update so that tracing can be temporary disabled from within the app, without having to revoke it’s permissions or turn off bluetooth entirely, as there is no point leaving tracking enabled when I am separated from my phone."
au;5;"Hoping this helps to get rid of virus for good and ease restrictions. 

Clearly indicated everywhere, app available to download early, live and ready to register numbers till 6:00 EAT.

Update 10.05.20:

After bug fixes apps does not need to be open with unlocked screen and battery in save mode. Better functionality."
au;5;I heard it was good, I got it, now what?
au;5;"This app is a great help for COVID19 because it notifies you when you come in contact with someone with or has come in contact with someone else with coronavirus. 
If we want to stop this we all need to download this app!!!!!"
au;1;Don’t install this app, I’m trying to the battery, uses your location, and what happens if you had an Apple Watch or pair AirPods, I would not connect
au;3;"We’re hearing that this app hasn’t collected data yet. Until health authorities / the CMO acknowledges that COVID-19 can be spread with contact a LOT less than 15 minutes and remember that this is not the flu...
This app needs a custom sensitivity setting. To allow me to set my own time between 1 and 15 minutes.
The app is ineffective otherwise.
Privacy concerns are also moot while the app isn’t sensitive enough and collect enough data."
au;4;Apple was already creating a similar feature in rhevnextviOS release. What m RUNNING IOS 13.5 Public beta 3 and the app does not appear to be an app that supports the new Covid-19 health feature. Hopefully there will be an update soon.
au;1;Stops apple watch connecting to phone. Kills the battery.
au;5;We really needed a good covid tracker app like this to save us, great app
au;5;In all Australians interest to download
au;5;Our doctors and nurses are begging us to use this app. That’s enough for me.
au;2;"When I clicK “Upload My Details” on the main Page of this aPP, a screen of text comes uP saying “You have tested Positive to COVID-19”. It then asKs if I consent to uPloading my info. I WOULD consent to this but I KNOW I have not tested Positive for COVID-19. I don’t Know if this is an error with the program or just bad wording, but I am now concerned that if I do my civic duty and uPload my Personal details to the aPP that I will be incorrectly recorded as a Possibly contagious carrier of the virus. 
Honestly, I’m now a little concerned about rePorting this issue..."
au;3;"One person in my house has deleted the app because the notifications are annoying and stupid. Saying to keep it active is like having Karen explaining how to be “on the line” on the interwebz. 
Limit the notifications to maybe a reminder to have the app open in the background and Bluetooth on whenever you leave the house should surely be enough. Then maybe have a link/menu on the open screen to provide information to Karen about what it means to have the app “active”."
au;3;When I leave the app alone and when I get a notification saying to check if the app is still active it takes me to the screen where I set up my details over again. This happened to me like 3 times now. Maybe even more. Fix this pronto please.
au;3;I believe in the concept of this app, but the daily alert to keep Bluetooth and locations on is tedious. It’s also confusing for elderly who then think it’s telling them to do something and  maybe they’ve accidentally turned it off, so spend ages checking everything. Please please get rid of that, it’s not necessary, and it s really making me want to turn off notifications which defeats the purpose. You want ppl to keep the app with notifications on then don’t send repetitive unnecessary notifications to ppl trying to do the right thing.
au;1;"This app only works when in the foreground, if you minimise it it will stop using Bluetooth, it may be in the background with other apps but doing nothing. Worst of all when it is running in the foreground and working it is chewing up battery life. Total a waste of time.
Apparently this fail only applies to iPhone."
au;3;"To the developers:

iPhone X iOS 13.5 app ver 1.1
-> when Bluetooth is off error message is “check your permissions” instead of “turn the Bluetooth on”

-> no error message when the app is closed (e.g. accidentally), there could be an *optional* reminder connected to geofencing (e.g. remind to turn on the app when leaving home)

-> hope you’re working on the background issue as you know that the behavior of apps in background is not always stable"
au;2;Happy to sign up and hope the app helps in the long term. But the non “notifications” are annoying. If there is nothing to notify why does it keep sending them? This could be counter productive to people’s cooperation.
au;3;I support the app and completely understand the need, but please stop the number of notifications. Apps that constantly notify me are the first apps people delete. Please fix.
au;4;The app produces daily notifications telling me to use the app - which I am already using. Unfortunately there seems to be no way of switching these off without switching off all notifications - which would defeat the purpose of the app.
au;3;OK, I downloaded the app because I thought it would help BUT I get sent a notification at least once a day. I don’t mind having the app running in the background, like a set and forget app but I DO NOT WANT A NOTIFICATION EVERY SINGLE DAY. Just notify me if you need me to upload my info. I’m not a child, I don’t need to be reminded that the app is on my phone and frankly, I am so over all the advice and info on Coronavirus. I get it, I am implementing all the social distancing and hygiene measures........ I just want to get on with life!  STOP SENDING ME NOTIFICATIONS EVERY DAY. It is probably (at this time) the number 1 reason I will delete the app!
au;5;So simple download register leave running. A great to to help the nation through this crazy time.
au;4;I see this is a way of keeping us all safe. Pity they need an app for it. But they gotta deal with some dumb public that thinks this app tracks you or something. It uses Bluetooth which can’t be tracked. Anyway let’s all do the right thing and download it so we can get back to our lives.
au;5;When I first heard about this app, I was not sure wanting to join. However, once expecting my beauty business to be open again, I realize how much I need to keep my customers safe. Had mine installed now and I’m asking all my customers to have it too if they are having appointments at my business. So great full to  the App !
au;5;This is a really good and trustworthy app
au;5;This app is wonderful, i would like to know, how do you even make an app that detects human viruses? Thank you Australia’s government!
au;2;"It chewed up 70% of phone battery in 4 hours.... The point is that it’s on all the time but how can you do that when your phone is dead? 70% usually lasts me about 10-12 hours.
It’s just not feasible or reasonable for me to keep it running"
au;5;"I do not know why this is not enforced in Australia as legal requirement, our data is trusted with apple, google, Samsung and iPhone.... but not the government

When our data is leaked by these companies, we go to the government to protect us through OAIC or lawyers who are enforced by government and Australian laws / constitutions"
au;4;"Would be great if there was a counter to see how many people you have come into contact with over the course of a day with a running total 
This would help show just how quickly one person could spread or catch something when they are out in public."
au;2;I get as far as putting my mobile number in & I just keep getting an error message saying my mobile number is wrong. I’ve deleted & reinstated the app. No change.
au;3;"I tried multiple times on different days including reinstalling the app over 3 times.
I read a review to turn of wifi and this worked for me. Unfortunately it would not work with my surname with the ‘ in it.
Love the idea but needs to be easier to sign up because not everyone will keep trying when it doesn’t work."
au;1;I have tried to register on an IPhone 7 with latest software and gives me an error both with 0 and without in front of my number. Useless
au;1;I noticed poor audio in Bluetooth earphones when Covid19 is running on iPhone 7
au;3;"I downloaded & set the app up on my iPhone. It was very easy to do & you are allowed to use a different name.
The next day I read on Apple news that the app doesn’t work on iPhone’s when the locked setting is on."
au;5;The green let’s you know the app is running...
au;1;Well if i get this the goverment knows my location.  Making them an fbi agent but i already have an fbi agent so theres no need to get it
au;1;"Stop continuously sending pointless notifications!!! Who designs these apps!??

If these don’t stop within the next week I’m going to delete the app."
au;1;Terrible app
au;2;Three times a day the app pings to tell me to not turn off my Bluetooth. My Bluetooth is constantly on. If the notifications continue like this I’m uninstalling due to thinking something serious is happening when it’s just a tech glitch.
au;1;Every time a COVID app notification pops up on my phone if I’m on a phone call all calls suddenly drop out. Not cool!
au;3;When I’m in isolation like at home, I switched  off my Bluetooth  to save  data, and only switched it on when I am out and about. Hopefully this COVIDSafe app developers should respect that and stop sending me text.
au;3;The repeated reminders to turn blue tooth on even though it is on are very annoying.
au;4;Hey guys. Not sure if this a one off user problem or not, but I’m having to re validate myself every morning when I open the app from the push notification.
au;1;"Notifications are sent multiple times a day and text messages. You asked people to sign up to this and then spam them?
Deleting the app until it’s fixed."
au;2;I dowloaded app and registered. Accidentally I deleted the app. Then re-installed app. But now phone registration is failing. Error verifying phone number.
au;1;"What a tremendous idea. To have an app running quietly in the background on our phones. A silent sentinel guarding us against potential spread. 

But it doesn’t work in the background on iPhones. The Government has still failed to take the correct advice and so the app is still failing to work. 

Time and time again governments fail by not listening. Come on SloMo, pull your finger out and get this sorted."
au;2;Downloaded the app and set it up easily and seemed very simple to use however noticed that every time I open it I have to re-register. Does it work if not registered? As I’m sure I’m not going to remember to do this every time I leave the house and therefore makes it ineffective
au;1;The app has been released too soon, despite developers providing feedback on this app before release it was hastily pushed out. This morning opening the app it asked to register!
au;1;"I have had to reopen the app every day, sometimes several times a day because I keep getting notifications that it needs to be active. I have the app, I open the app but I can’t be expected to constantly check that it’s running or have it in the foreground with my phone unlocked all the time. 
Please make it run better in the background and stop it from continuously crashing/closing and sending notifications. You’ll have people deleting the app you’re trying so hard to encourage people to use and once they delete it you might not get them to add it back"
au;1;I had the app but since have deleted it. They’re so insistent on sending a notification at 9am every morning telling me to turn Bluetooth on despite it being on. I don’t want to know anything about it unless I’m exposed. If I turn notifications off then I won’t know of any potential risk. Stop wasting my time!
au;1;It seems to not work unless your iPhone is unlocked with the app on the screen. That is pointless and defeats the purpose of it. What a waste of our tax paying resources for a useless app that won’t actually assist.
au;5;"It would be great if this app shows us the map and places we have been to in past few weeks.
As long as it is helping all of us I am happy to keep it as long as we need it. We have to fight together to beat Covid-19."
au;1;This app does not work! The concept itself has major fundamental issues.
au;1;Wish I could rate this 0 stars, a waste of $3m for an app that wasn’t scoped effectively to be developed and released with known fundamental design flaws. It cannot do what it promises to do, it’s a joke.
au;3;"One star for the government
One star
For the media
One star for How dumb the media makes them look (even though dumb is singing in waves) as per usual. That is terrible"
au;5;"Has anyone received a false notification that they have tested positive to the China virus ?
I have and never been tested.!!

Did writers of the app ever consider the psychological implications on recipients of a false positive notification?"
au;1;Doesn’t work when the app is closed. How is it supposed to be useful then?
au;1;"Downloaded to meet SloMo’s numbers
Deleting it now for 2 reasons
1. I live in Victoria and Kim Jong Dan, our despot premier, will never ease restrictions. We will be at stage 7 by the end of the month and only allowed to leave our bedroom once a week to go to the toilet.
2. I am not leaving my phone permanently unlocked!"
au;1;I downloaded and deleted. Didn’t help in easing restrictions, drains my battery, so what’s the point?
au;1;I chose to say no to certain questions and now it doesn’t want to work. Obviously I don’t actually have any control over the app as the GOV said I did
au;4;Would love to download but it won’t even take my phone number 😩😐
au;3;"Why is my rating only 3 star?
No reason known to me why it is not 5, therefore worries me for  no good reason I can think of.....
Guy Pease
0419225619"
au;1;Tells me it won’t work unless open. My battery is flat in 4 hours. Had to delete
au;3;"Would be utilised more and more user friendly if the app could run in the background without always needing to be opened (as this drains a lot of battery and is just inconvenient). If users are able to just turn on Bluetooth and opt to have the app run in the background, I believe more people would use this service. 

Good idea."
au;1;"Irrespective of the merits of benefits of such an app, my poor rating is because for me the app is useless. I cannot register my mobile number and so cannot participate in the program. 

The developers also deserve a low rating because of the lack of detail in the revision history. Simply saying “bug fixes” gives me no indication that I should upgrade. It’s a lazy behaviour that many develops exhibit."
au;1;This app can’t work in the background. Doesn’t do what it is advertised to do.
au;4;"Hi Mr Hunt & developers.

I’d like to suggest an icon at the top of the screen e.g. between the wifi icon & the time.

The icon should indicate if the app is currently operating correctly (green spinning covid safe icon)  or if it is off line (red spinning covid safe icon). 

I have an iPhone & I cant tell if the app is operating correctly, without opening the app & having a look. 

Hope this helps.

Cheers
Brendan"
au;1;The app only works if you leave notifications on, so that you can be notified in the case that you have been in contact with someone who has the virus. But the owners of the app abuse this privilege by sending me notifications every day that have nothing to do with possible infections. So I have deleted the app.
au;5;Just download the app so we can go out to a cafe or a restaurant. The people not downloading are just selfish and only thinking about themselves. They are also on Facebook etc guess what you are traced more on google and Facebook than this app. So just download the app...
au;4;"Every day or so when sitting at home I get a notification on my lock screen, but upon opening the app the notification is either a reminder to keep the app working in the background and Bluetooth on when in meetings and out in public, or there appears to be no actual reason for the notification at all.
I’m keeping the app and Bluetooth on, so the reminder seems pointless and annoying. 
Please ensure if we get notifications from the App that there is a valid reason for us to investigate what it wants to tell us."
au;2;"Constant push notifications ‘We need you to help stop the spread of Covid-19...’ asking me to enable my Bluetooth while it is already enabled and the app is installed successfully and working are driving me nuts. 
Should be able to turn off the push notifications unless it’s an urgent one such as notification of Covid-19 exposure or at the very least let me select how frequently I want to receive push notifications."
au;1;I have had to reload this app to my I5 & I7 Apple phones up to 11 between both phones as it keeps dumping the app. You want people to down load it but it keeps failing. So I now have not bothered to reload the covidsafe app. Cheers a concerned  Australian who wants to use & do the right thing to others.
au;1;I am always prompted with an Error verifying phone number. As the +61 is already provided, I only put my 9-digit phone number without the leading zero but it keeps popping the error. Also tried putting the leading 0 but still the same error.
au;5;Do your part for the country
au;1;While I support the need for an app, it seems the HCI designers need to get back to their year 9 classrooms, rather than pretending to build serious apps. The whole idea of having a smart phone is to use it for a variety of applications in quick succession. smart phones are not supposed to be dedicated data loggers that can only do one thing. While I would like to run COVIDSafe when I go to the supermarket, how can I then check my shopping list, phone my partner to check the brand of cheese on the list, respond to an sms, etc, etc. A massive fail by the devolopers or maybe the government procurement officers/ ministers who have accepted a dud and foisted it onto public.
au;1;Issues on IOS.   Constantly need to restart the app after a period of time or using other apps.  Doesn’t really work in ‘ background mode’ so you can’t be sure that it’s recording as designed.
au;1;Why did I download it when it doesn’t work on iPhones? I keep getting messages that I need to keep Bluetooth running for the app to work?  When my iPhone is in sleep mode Bluetooth is always switched off!
au;5;App registered in 30 seconds or less. If you are in a role for an ‘essential service’ this should be a no brainer.
au;5;"Every data point is worthwhile.

I have no concerns about privacy given the way the app works and the type of data collected.

What I do get annoyed about are the self righteous idiots that are stumbling blocks to this app.

Barnaby Joyce as an example. Just go back to your rabbit hole.

All the tinfoil hat flat earthers (antivaxxers) can immigrate to another country and raise the IQ of this country."
au;2;It does nothing. Don’t bother downloading it.
au;5;"Do you want to go back to the pub?
If yes: Download the app.
If no: Other people want to go to the pub, so download the app."
au;5;Simple and easy to install. With this it’ll be so much easier to limit the spread and be able to go back to normal life... come on people- download the app. Do the right thing.
au;2;I don’t have any complaints except that you have to run the app constantly - it’s easy to accidentally close when closing other apps.
au;5;So far so good. No probs with battery life etc. If it means easier contact tracing then I’m all for it.
au;1;Deleted after finding out it is hosted by Amazon.
au;1;This app only records handshake data from physical interactions if the app is open in the foreground and on screen. If the app isn’t on screen or your phone screen is off it doesn’t work. Obviously nobody is going to leave the app open and on screen everywhere they go, which renders it utterly useless and obsolete. Total waste of time and immoral to spread false hope like this is even a solution.
au;3;When it’s publicly available, then sure.
au;3;"What's the point in me having this if the people that are out and about spreading Mrs. Rona either don't care enough, or don't trust the government enough (with good reason) to even download it. 

I've been using it though during exercise and drives to the store just in case I get pulled up on it as i'm not sure how any of these new lockdown laws work (as do all the police that have pulled me over during this weird time). 

I've yet to walk past someone with Rona."
au;1;Probably would be a great app if it worked. After initial download and sign up it lasted 2 days then it seems to have reset and asks me to sign up again every couple of days, I have done this 3 more times over the week so now I have given up.
au;3;"Download and activity should be mandatory until a vaccine is available. 
Needs a symbol that it is active (nothing fancy that wastes battery) but just a pulsating button (red??) that show Bluetooth is on and app is running"
au;1;I have had to re- register nearly every second day as the app seems to forget who I am.  I get a text most days telling me to sign up.  I really want this app to work and for millions to download it, but my confidence in it actually working for me is very low.
au;5;Please stop thinking the government is stealing your information. If you do you should probably see a doctor. Enough said.
au;1;Useless iPhone without using Apple’s/Google’s API. Please implement it. Won’t use until it’s implemented.
au;5;Good
au;1;"Had downloaded the app on the night it was released and had thought the app was active with blue tooth on. Now, nearly 2 weeks later while discussing this with my daughter we discovered that my app was not active. APPARENTLY the app needs to stay green on the whole phone screen. 

I’m very disappointed that this is not explained on the green screen and if you do close the screen there is no warning that the device is now inactive. 

I had been getting texts saying to keep the app on with Bluetooth, however think is is a standard text sent to everyone.

Also this review won’t allow a nick name easily, says names are taken. Over and over again. 

Not Happy. 😡"
au;4;"Just super annoying every morning I get a push notification from the app which is always the same thing. I would only want to be notified if I walked around and someone near me had contracted Coronavirus, not just to open the app! 
And you can’t turn push notifications off or it says it’s not “actively tracking” me. Like what does that have to do with anything?? 
I’ve downloaded it because I want to get home to my family. But dam if it isn’t annoying"
au;1;I have been walking around this whole time thinking that I was connected and would be notified if I come into contact with someone that tests positive to Covid19... turns out I was carrying around an inactive app that is inactive 😞😞😞
au;5;Your forebears has to fight for their freedoms, all we have to do is chill. So chill, download this app and let’s survive COVID-19.
au;3;"In kind of over the daily notifications to keep the app open. Which I appreciate is as a result of apple iOS design. However, Apple has the same functionality in beta which this app should leverage the API for which would remove the requirement to keep the app open. Until then, this app is actually kinda useless...

I would also like to see what data has been collected. That way I can validate if it's collecting the right info or right amount."
au;2;Great app so far. Love the design and the idea. HOWEVER, if the app doesn’t stop sending me notifications every day, I’m going to delete it. I don’t mind getting notifications once a week if there’s anything important I need to know, but don’t bug me every single day with useless information. Learn how users react to notification spam. When you annoy people, you lose goodwill and they WILL delete it. That’s not a chance you should be taking with such an important app. The only notifications I should be getting are (A) if my Bluetooth is off and the app won’t work properly, or (B) there’s important news that I need to know. That’s it. Please don’t make me delete this app. It’s not hard to fix!
au;1;I really wanted to do my bit, but I have given up using the app because it keeps signing me out, even though I have the app open and Bluetooth on.
au;1;"What’s the notification for? The app is running. Bluetooth is on. If you keep sending me pointless notifications I’ll just turn them off, and now the whole point of the app is defeated. 

Leave me alone unless you have something critically important to tell me.

Update: v1.1 still does this! STOP IT THIS IS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE."
au;5;"Great idea
But the constant notifications/ reminder to leave Bluetooth on is abit annoying especially when my Bluetooth is always on"
au;1;I really want this app to work, and play my part in this crisis but unfortunately I’ve been constantly logged out of the app - causing me to have to resign up almost daily. This app needs to be fixed ASAP otherwise it’s just another great idea that won’t help anyone...
au;5;"As always you’d expect the Aus Government to measure once and cut twice, but in this instance they haven’t.

The app is very good and very easy to register on. You can use you initials or similar if you’re worried about privacy and your data isn’t used or uploaded without you doing it.

I just wish people would put their tin foil hats down and download the app!!!"
au;4;Great idea, however, it’s kept asking for registration repeatedly. Thus, does it mean I will get a new ID and can’t track back my previous ID?
au;2;Downloaded it the first day but have now stopped notifications as I keep getting all the same reminders. If I’ve gone to the trouble of downloading the app, don’t treat me like an idiot and keep telling me to leave my Bluetooth on etc.
au;5;"I’m not the type to trust any government body but feel reassured by reading the privacy policy, data deletion after 21 days and being able to use a pseudonym. I can give the Gov my phone number and access to my Bluetooth if it helps save lives. Feels good to know I’m assisting with contact tracing. 

Hopefully it allows us to move to a new normalcy 👍"
au;5;"The app installed perfectly on my phone no bugs or glitches as of yet, solid app. I trust our information is safe in the governments hands. 

Great idea I would have implemented this app in the same way if I were in charge. 15mins of you being in the area of a COVID-19 patient and you will be alerted, outstanding work."
au;1;"CovidSafe drains battery like crazy... my battery today went from 30% to 4% in the space of 10 minutes.
Friends that work at Telstra have also had customers come in with lost contacts and photos.
Rushed app, the government needs to fix it for it to be useful."
au;1;^
au;5;I have got a lot of people to come in to close contact with the virustot
au;1;The app itself doesn’t even work as advertised. It only works if the iPhone is unlocked, and the app is running in the foreground. If that isn’t happening then the app is 100% useless. There is proof of this all over Twitter. (@tomwarren being one account). See for yourselves.
au;5;Set up on IphoneX  or 11 easy and followed previous reviews. Updated app has rotating symbol to show working. Once set up go to settings scroll down to COVIDSafe app > notifications untick notification to lock screen.Leave other settings as is.  App appears to run normally in background but without annoying reminders. Assume they’ll contact if necessary.
au;5;An important part of public safety. Download this app
au;5;Well done to the team that built the app. Battery drain is less than 1% per day (which was one of my initial concerns). Can’t wait to see the source code, but bug free for me and privacy is spot on with what they have said all along.
au;3;Easy to download but can’t be used on iPhones? I’ve downloaded it and applied latest update but I’m not leaving my phone unlocked all the time. I thought maybe having app open and phone locked helped, but reading a lot of articles this is not the case. So basically it’s useless on iPhones. That’s sad, because it’s a great helpful app for department of health in Australia.
au;1;"If this view version continues to nag me at 9am every morning and if it doesn’t work with notifications disabled then I will have to delete it.  
What’s with the nagging?!?!  Good implementation ruined by this stupid detail."
au;1;This app is currently kind of pointless as it requires your phone to be unlocked and the app to be actively open on your screen for it to function effectively (a limitation of iOS not the developers). I very much hope with the upcoming release of iOS 13.5 that there are plans to upgrade this app to use the native exposure notification api that apple and google have developed. Most other countries around the world have already conceded that supporting this is the best way forward. I hope we follow and get rid of the background limitations this app would currently have. Are there any plans to do this?
au;4;I’m puzzled that authorities believe it takes 15 minutes to catch COVID-19 off an infected person.  Shouldn’t this app be registering contacts of shorter duration for it to be effective?  I certainly won’t allow myself to remain within 1.5 metres of another for a lengthy 15 minutes, but could have the misfortune of someone passing me in the grocery aisle as they sneezed.
au;5;App is great and stores all data in the phone, data is shared only if you get tested positive and you agree to share it. It was 3rd party reviews and they found it totally safe from a privacy point of view. Whoever doesn't download it because of privacy concerns is either misinformed or a fool.
au;5;The latest update version of app icon on 05/05/2020 makes it less attractive to use.
au;5;"1. Since installed cannot see Bluetooth devices near me therefore not able to able to connect. iPhone 5s. Intermittent. 
2. Writing very light on white therefore difficult to read when reporting issues.
3. Installed it on wife’s phone and app looks different to my iPhone5s, hers iPhone 8."
au;1;I thought this would be helpful for when I travel to do essential shopping as I live rural but realised after a few days that it wasn’t working and constantly giving notifications to keep app open soon as I had app in background or not actually open I would get notifications prompting me to open it, today i delete it until further work has gone into the app as of right now not having the app is the same as having it either way it appears not to be working so for tracing purposes it’s useless
au;1;"Since downloading the app our phones keep crashing (3 phones several times a day).

Also annoying that I keep getting notifications to download the app when I already have.  I check the notification and it says I don’t have to do anything."
au;5;"While trying to register myself I get an error msg which says - Error verifying phone number. Advice please.
Also in the Apple App Store there is no contact email or phone number for app support - not good Scomo - so I had to resort to rating the app to communicate with the developer - sigh!
————
5 May 20 Now running perfectly.
Even like the gentle reminder each day if the app or Bluetooth are off.
Well done developers - you might even become legends if the Govt mandates this app as part of AUS lockdown restrictions easing - personally I think it should be mandated in pubs - clubs - cinemas - restaurants etc so I become aware of any CV19 infected ppl near me 👍🤘👍"
au;3;Every time I try to enter in my information it says it is texting me a code to do so, but the code never comes. I can't use the app to it's full potential.
au;4;This is a great idea and hopefully saves live but unfortunately if it is running it blocks other Bluetooth devices from working correctly. If the app is running in the background on a apple device running ver 13.4.1 your watch will not connect and vehicles do not connect properly.
au;1;"The most difficult thing i ever tried to do wont accept pin 
4 attempts i give up and my wife has too 
So put if a family of 3 none could do it
Surely you can load it without signing in to apple which i cant remember the password and email is no longer active no way to get it reset 
Can you make a simpler version"
au;3;The app runs fine but I’m notified daily to keep Bluetooth on and the app running. It is SO annoying. If I get one more I’m deleting it. No one enjoys being nagged by their phone.
au;5;It great app no glitches and works fine so suggest to get it
au;3;Why am I being asked everyday to activate the app? I leave it live and the check each day to ensure I have registered etc. The app says it is active. The daily message is annoying. Please stop it otherwise I will turn notifications off and therefore might as well not have the app. A deluge of unnecessary notifications is annoying not helpful
au;1;"I’ve installed it but gotta say I’m not going to keep it open until they make it work
Properly for iPhones. Leave a phone unlocked? Really? Not ideal for most users. My husband has an Andrei is and seems to be a much better setup."
au;3;It appears I cannot upload my information and is telling me to ask the health assistant (think that who it is) for help but I can’t find where he or she is!!!!!  As you can tell I’m not terribly computer savvy.
au;1;The app doesn’t function correctly on my IPhone 10. Every 24 hours prompted to re-enter my Information.
au;5;Have seen no change in my phones battery utilisation and the app just runs fine in the background with no interaction needed. Have had no issues setting it up and get the occasional notification that the app is working.
au;3;"I really don’t need to be reminded every day to keep the app running.

Make it stop!"
au;5;This is how I get them
au;5;"Had it on my phone since day 1
No problems 
Battery life on phone the same. Occasional messages send regarding the virus.
Good feature it reminds you of Bluetooth is off. Download it make a difference 😷"
au;1;Hi, how do you know if app on iOS is working or not ?
au;1;I tried several times but don’t receive the pin
au;5;It’s ok but it’s hard to know who else isn’t using it since the people wearing invisible tinfoil hats don’t. If you want more ppl to download load it add a game to it that shows how many ppl you infected, or a gambling add on so you can bet on how many ppl you may have killed, just a thought but if you stop Snot  Moron pushing it will fly off the shelf.
au;5;If all Australian had this app we could make a real difference, strongly recommend.
au;2;App is fine I guess but every day I get a message encouraging me to install it, which I did a week ago. It’s very annoying. Why do they keep pestering me?
au;3;What happens when my Bluetooth is actually off and I come across a COVID+ person?
au;2;It seems to be having problems with iphone . I have put my number but doesnt let me verify it as i dont receive the pin
au;1;App refuses to recognise my phone number. Attempted to register with the usual +61 425 etc, and also attempted with +61 0425 etc. Both to no avail. My mobile is a modern iPhone on a long-standing Telstra plan. Private industry would have sorted out a big like this in 5 minutes.
au;5;Just download it and keep it running
au;1;"I’m Sorry but 
1) “My contacts” are mine! 
2) My contacts are people with whom i share personal, professional and intimate relationships with. 
3) These relationships are are built on foundations of honesty and rely on strong ethicality. 
4) we are in lockdown what makes you think we would be running into our contacts so conveniently. 
5) I am very confident the contacts I could possibly rendezvous with, wouldn’t hesitate to make me aware of their exposure IMMEDIATELY.  If I happened to have unknown or unpopular contacts, what is the likelihood of a chance interaction infected or uninfected?
6) your app insults our intelligence.  It mocks our commitment to the common good and undermines our commonsense. It’s just an opportunity to plunder our privacy, sell it to the highest bidder and look forward to the next election campaign, ‘that magically paid for itself!"
au;1;Gives an error can’t sign up.
au;2;"Thanks Australian government for your initiatives to get this application out. 

However when the app periodically use Bluetooth to check surrounding area, already connected Bluetooth devices like headphones and speakers experienced light glitches or complete disconnection based on my testing.

This could discourage people who commute/working by cars (connecting with Bluetooth in vehicles) or people who worked in professional service industry (who are always on Bluetooth headphones) to install the app"
au;1;"App won’t accept my mobile number and NO I’m Not using the zero at start of number!
Did try once with zero but same result.
Keeps saying error verifying number.
 iPhone 10 so not old technology.
Poor effort"
au;5;Only one thing is that, below the question, “Has a health official asked you to upload your information?” there should be two buttons. Either, a “YES” or “NO. If the user select “NO” the message which says, “There’s nothing else you need to do, except to leave the app running and keep Bluetooth on.” appears. If the user select “YES”, then “Upload my information” button should appears. I hope they fix that soon. Thanks.
au;3;Would it be possible to extend the app to other app stores to enable foreign students and nationals to download the app.
au;5;Totally fine and no issues with battery life or anything else. Might as well have another tool in the toolkit.
au;1;Doesn’t want to work on my phone. Keeps telling me that my number & details are incorrect 🤔🤔
au;5;Stop the spread. Download the app.
au;5;Responsible citizens should take extra step to make the community safe . The least we could do is download the app. We living in history during this unexpected times - let’s be selfless and do what the govt. says . Questions about privacy is secondary when you have a smart phone in your hand .
au;5;Y’all should download it bc when they hit their target of downloads they’ll open pubs again
au;4;I installed the app and as soon as I entered I went into where I upload information or something and it said I have Covid-19. I never got tested, I don’t think. I had a blood test 2 days ago but for something else. Did the blood test pick it up??
au;1;Now that I have downloaded the app, I keep getting annoying messages to download the app.
au;1;Not able to register , it keeps giving me the message: error verifying phone number , please check details and try again
au;2;Useless, it logs itself out all the time and doesn’t stay open in the phone memory for long. Sure there was a better way to do this
au;4;I think it’s a great idea however all the notifications are alarming. Eg daily messages saying to have your Bluetooth on etc. just now I got a text saying to download the app I already have. Worried I won’t be paying attention when a real notification occurs.
au;5;The app is working well without any battery drain issues. Note that an individual has control over whether the app is running  and gov’t needs permission to access your phone data so that should alleviate any concerns re privacy.  I think everyone should use this app so we can get back to normal-ish life.
au;1;Downloaded it twice and it just won’t open. Comes up with main screen then just keeps going back to black screen and nothing else 🤷‍♂️
au;5;Get tha pubs OPPPEEENNNN 💯
au;2;This app crashed other apps on my iPhone 8. When I removed the app the other apps stopped crashing.
au;2;"The data, once you consent to it being uploaded from your app at the time you test positive, will be held by the federal government on an Amazon Web Services server in Australia. - source: The Guardian

Global tech giant Amazon may not be able to protect Australian Government data held in its Australian servers — including data gathered by the COVID-19 tracing app released on Sunday — from US subpoenas, according to legal experts and crossbenchers.                                             Data from the Government's new COVIDSafe tracing app may be currently obtainable by US law enforcement via the CLOUD Act.                      While COVIDSafe data will remain in Australia, it is held by US-based company Amazon, which can be legally compelled to provide that data to US law enforcement.                                            Amazon was awarded the contract for the COVIDSafe app data storage over several Australian-based cloud services - source: ABC  News"
au;1;I can’t access the contents of the app, only the initial display reading “COVIDSafe”.  No functionality beyond showing the logo obviously renders it useless for all purposes.
au;2;"I don’t mind having the app.  I got the app for the txt that tells me I’ve had a contact, not a daily txt.
What I do mind is the daily txt."
au;1;Have to have the app running and open for it to work? No thanks... use the run in background tool - that’s what it’s for.... deleted.
au;5;This app is great so more people need to download it
au;1;If the app is intended to be installed by „all people” in Australia there shouldn’t be any obstacles in installing it. I had to change my Credit card and region to an Australia. There are many people who use foreign setup in their phones due to business reasons.
au;2;The app was flicking between information and the covidsafe title. I couldn’t control it. And couldn’t fix it. So I’m about to download it again.
au;5;Works well, does what it says on the label. I have my phones gps turned off and COVIDSafe still works so it does not care about your location and does no even ask for access. Easy to setup. Negligible battery usage does not even show in my top 10 battery users. A+++
au;5;I agree to many Australians that this app is fantastic, it doesn’t use up battery, it does locate where you are but it’s for our safety which I hope you all completely understand. This app will locate where you are so when they find someone who does have COVID 19 they will see who they where close by to and have a look at the location but that is all. I hope that many Australians get this app so that our lives can go back to normal soon, the more people getting the app the closer we get to a healthier and happier life. When everything was our everyday life!
au;4;It’s fine, and it’s great it’s available so quickly - that would have been a lot of effort :) But getting daily notifications that ‘everything is ok and remember to keep your Bluetooth on’ is a bit much. I’m not going to fiddle with notifications in settings because having them on is the whole point right? But there’s a risk of notification fatigue/blindness if we get them every day, then if we come into contact with someone, we ignore the most important notification...
au;4;The Bluetooth message sent out every morning could possibly lead to people ignoring messages from the app in the morning deeming it’s just the same message when it could actually be a health warning.
au;4;"My only issue here is the overuse use of notifications. I’ve needlessly had the same messages come through a number of times telling me how to use the app which is kind of irritating. 

I feel notifications should only be used for important communications, not onboarding. 

I’m turning them off for now - hopefully this changes in a future update."
au;1;Stop every day push notifications or you are forcing us to delete it. We know when to use it.
au;1;It drained my battery so quickly that I missed out on an important phone call
au;5;"Low battery drain.
Would be great to show details so I know it’s working and more importantly show others the info it collects on screen, much easier to explain that it’s a good thing.

The log of my tempids so I can see they change.
The log of contacts to see what info is being broadcast and stored."
au;4;The app works fine and normally uses little battery. BUT if it is being displayed, it prevents the Lock Screen from working causing serious battery problems and security risk if  phone is lost.
au;1;I have deleted this app as it does not work on my iPhone. I leave my Bluetooth on and the app open in the background, but it keeps telling me I have turned my Bluetooth off or they need me to keep Australia safe and to open the app. This happens even after a few minutes. Seems to only be happy if I have my phone unlocked and the app open on the screen, which is unrealistic.
au;1;Useless on iOS unless you change your display settings for the screen to constantly stay on and also make sure the app is always open in the foreground. If you don’t do this, After a certain amount of time of running in the background Bluetooth stops working. This is a purpose built safety feature of iOS devices.
au;3;The app keeps asking to enter my details. I have done this more than 5 times since downloading on the first day of availability.
au;5;Download this app to protect your fellow Aussies. It’s easy to register and you don’t need an email account to register. Just a few clicks to stay safe from coronavirus. It’s also pretty dang useful if you are near someone who is diagnosed with COVID19 because you get notified. I Recommend downloading to stay safe. 😄
au;1;The app won’t accept my mobile number. Tried keeping the 0 and dropping the 0 it says there is an error with the number and to put in a correct number. Clearly I know my phone number. Please fix your app if you expect people to use it.
au;1;Doesn’t work on I phone unless open on front screen. Needs to be fixed to be effective
au;4;The app has not addressed possible false positives from apartment living. My phone Bluetooth can pick up neighbours at least 2-3 apartments left, right, up or below.
au;1;For all my family members the app dis not woek simply because no pin was ever sent ? And yes we did reinstall and yes we omitted the leading 0 in the mobile nr .. Anyone who can help is welcome!
au;3;Downloaded the app, put in my details, left it running in the background but then a day later I start getting messages from the app that I should sign up etc. Did this three times now and the same thing keeps happening! Very annoying.
au;5;Please let us tel our family and friends to download this app because I am sure if everyone in Australia download everything back to normal. Thanks.
au;1;"Would get more community support if it were available in other languages besides English.  We are a multicultural nation and we should do everything to stop the spread in all communities.

   If we follow guidelines to keep social distance, then there should be no contacts recorded.  

Voting is compulsory in Australia, so why is this app not compulsory?   What about people who do not own smartphones?

So many have downloaded but it still has not gone live.  That will be the test that it actually works."
au;1;Today I lost my phone and because the COVIDSafe app was running, the person who found my phone had complete access to EVERYTHING. Everything!!!! All my photos, notes, contacts you name it. As much as I want to promote this app as it is important for tracing, unfortunately, I will be deleting it. I was lucky that the person who found my phone was a good person but when I think of all the damage they could have done given the details they had access too, I cannot afford to take that chance again.
au;5;Privacy Concerns? Should’ve thought before taking Facebook quiz to find what frozen characters you are
au;1;Every day I get a push notification telling me to keep Bluetooth on and the app open - when I click on the notification it asks me to register... I’ve had to fill out and submit the registration details every day for the last four days, it doesn’t store the details?
au;1;I’m on an iOS device with the latest system version and am unable to enter my phone number. I get a verification error. I’ve tried multiple times, with and without a preceding zero.
au;5;This is the kind of exponential growth we want. Encourage two others to download, and ask them to do the same
au;1;This app is constantly turning off by itself. Each day I get the reminder to turn it on even though I’ve not turned off the app or the phone
au;1;I downloaded the app, but when it came to my husband.. The app did not download, because his version of iOS was not enough!! Can you imagine how many elderly people cannot download this??? Stupid stupid stupid!!! Do you think app developers that this app only needs to keep YOU safe? Many elderly people carry old phones... Keep it simple so ALL can use it
au;1;This stupid add constantly send notifications telling me to keep it open. I already had it open and got fed up with constant notifications so I deleted it.
au;1;"Requires iOS 10 or greater !
I cannot use it on all my family’s phones, so it’s useless !"
au;3;I have no qualms with having this app, more info is shared through the other apps I use daily, and want to stop the spread. But is it actually working though? The daily notification tells you to make sure the app is running when out. Does that mean actually having your phone unlocked with the app going for it to work? That’s impossible, and even if you do the other people around you don’t have it open so it’s not tracing anything? There needs to be clarification on this.
au;1;Some of us dinosaurs still have our old iPhones which can’t be upgraded to iOS 10.0.  Would love to participate in this but can’t download the COVIDSafe App.
au;2;"Is 15 minutes of proximity really required to transfer the virus? 

If you had close contact with someone, eg shook hands, coughed,  spoke without a mask, used a shopping trolley without wiping it down, etc couldn't you catch/spread the virus? But that contact wouldn't register on the app because it only took a few seconds.

Keep a diary: Every evening record where you've been and who you've been in contact with during the day."
au;1;Tried entering all the details. But it comes back with an error saying it can’t validate my number. A waste of my time.
au;1;Will not except pin
au;4;We want all Australians to use this app, but many will delete it if you keep up with the annoying daily reminders to have it switched on.
au;1;I can’t even open the app to set it up at all and my phone is iPhone 11. Disappointed.
au;1;"Stop sending a message telling me to keep the app running and Bluetooth on. 
The app IS OPEN and my Bluetooth IS ON. Such a pain in the ass!"
au;1;"When installing the app. It asks you to turn on notifications so they can warn you if you come in contact with some with COVID19. But what they don’t tell you is that they will continually send you notifications to “stay home and stay safe”. 

I want the app. I just don’t constantly want my phone going off with stupid notifications."
au;1;Stop with the unnecessary notifications in the morning at 9:00am. We aren’t idiots. It’s demeaning and annoying. Remove or I’m removing the app.
au;2;Downloaded after a lot of deliberation, yet I can not register as a black COVIDSafe screen keeps flickering on my screen
au;1;Downloaded the app ok. However when I tried to use it, It dose not work. Keeps going back to opening back screen.
au;1;Tried a few time but still wasn’t able to receive the code to make an account
au;5;This app is such a brilliant idea. If everyone jumps on board and be responsible, we'll put a stop to this virus and save lives.l
au;4;Right idea but smashes the battery. Need to charge phone twice a day.
au;1;"1. Ok, it’s installed, but how do I know it’s working properly?
2. Why can’t the Government find a data store of its own that is secured either owned by an Australian based company or at a secure Government location?
3. Why hasn’t the source code been published so that it can be peer reviewed.
4. Why is there a need to enter Registration details when this information should only be entered when required?
5. Why has this been fast tracked when Apple and Google will provide a framework which would be interoperable internationally and will be implemented in such a way that data is decentralised and a external data store is not required.
6. This app will have severe limitations as it needs to be running in foreground, the Apple and Google framework does not require this.
7. Is there’s any evidence that this will provide an effective solution to contact tracing?"
au;1;"Downloaded the app
Can’t get past the initial page except to
Report that I do have or have been tested positive for the covid 19 infection which I haven’t . 
Deleted the app if I have to report I have something I don’t have I’m not interested now"
au;1;Every now and then when I open and use the app on my iPhone Xs, which runs 13.3.1, the black screen appears, showing grey letters of “COVIDSafe”. The screen would either stuck there forever or fades back to normal interface and then shows black again. Newest version of the app, no storage problems. Someone get it fixed pls!
au;3;App was fine other than chewing through my battery, I have deleted it atm as I’m not leaving the house so when I do go back to leaving the house again I with activate again
au;1;"Look it’s important I get that, but the principal is fundamentally flawed, unless you religiously carry your phone on your person which a lot of people don’t. Coupled with its ability to zap 50 percent of phone battery over night, and zap the battery of other Bluetooth devices asking them who or what they are. 

Constant Bluetooth handshakes if you want them or not

Flawed idea and poorly executed"
au;1;Great idea. I wish to use it on my Iphone 6SPlus. But even with the zero off my phone number the app will not recognise my number. Am unable to join. My number is correct and Im not placing the zero at the beginning.
au;1;I have signed up twice now? Every time I open it it’s asking me to register and sign up... when I do it says there is nothing else to do and the app is working .. then open it again to check it and it’s offering for me to sign up. Perhaps if that isn’t required and it is working then don’t prompt it - instead have a holding page saying the app is working
au;3;I’m very doubtful this works on iOS. My understanding is the app gets suspended when your screen locks or you press the home button.  The prompt “leave the app running“ when you open it seemed ambiguous. Are we expect to open the app and constantly unlock our phones when we are out in public?
au;1;I have a mini iPad that I take with me everywhere. I can’t receive the pin, there is no help to contact, very frustrating.
au;5;This app is essential. It is not foolproof but it is better then nothing. There is no reason not to download it and many reasons that you should download it. It is a must and more people need to use it, this app is no inconvenience but it is saving lives.
au;1;"In the info it says, if you’ve been near someone who has been in contact with coronavirus, you will get a call. 
That shows a big lack of ensuring all of us  are put into consideration. 
Not just those who are deaf but also those who are unable to communicate verbally. 
Please consider an alternative option for those like myself."
au;4;Updated my phone to IOS 13.4.1 (iPhone SE old). COVIDSafe displayed errors for Bluetooth settings which I couldn’t determine why ( all settings correct). Deleted and reinstalled the app. No longer getting errors.
au;1;App drained my iPhone SE from full charge to empty in 3 hours. Doesn’t work!!!
au;3;"Really chews the battery on iPhones.
It pushes the ‘brightness’ up to maximum. Very few users ever have the brightness up so far. Fix this, and it will be less hungry."
au;1;When I open the app, it flashes back and forth between the black screen with “COVIDSafe” and the welcome screen, too quick to click the button.
au;3;"Love the idea and the government’s proactive approach in rolling this out. But has a few errors that needs fixing kinda ASAP. 

1. I keep getting random notifications throughout the day to open the app again and again although I have never closed it. It should just run in the background. 

2. Sometimes I open the app and it shows me the registration screen all over again. I am already registered, so I gotta kill the app and open it again and then it’s running fine.

Hope with updates the app improves and these errors get taken care of."
au;1;"Downloaded the app, followed all instructions and continuously shows my Bluetooth as off (although it is on) and does not allow me to consent to “Allow Bluetooth” at all. I’ve deleted and reloaded app and tried all suggestions. Nothing had worked. 
Total fail for me. Idea was good but execution for iPhone for me was a complete fail. 
Here’s hoping other iPhone users have better success."
au;1;Whenever I open the app a black screen saying Covid safe keeps popping up. I can’t even fill in my details
au;5;You need to fix an issue that logs you out when the iphone turns off.
au;5;Pls add watch app!
au;3;App keeps logging me out and now I couldn’t be bothered to re-register.
au;2;The app is simple enough to register but the Bluetooth keeps preventing my phone from pairing with hands free in car and other Bluetooth devices. I generally have to either shutdown the app or go into my phone settings every time I get in the car to pair with hands free. Not only is this annoying but could be a safety issue for people driving.
au;5;Any plans to extend the app to iWatch? Normally don’t take my phone exercising.
au;3;Great initiative, but a possible glitch: when I’m streaming music over bluetooth to my wireless headphones, I wonder if this app makes the music cut off periodically - it appears to disconnect the headphones entirely. As I’m quite a heavy user of these headphones, unfortunately I can’t use the app at the same time. This issue with the music/headphones cutting out periodically (every 20mins or so? Sometimes more frequently) seemed to only begin when I’d installed the app.
au;4;It’s the like boy who cried wolf. I’ve got the app, my Bluetooth is on, I don’t need reminders everyday to keep it on. Keep the notifications only for when you need them please or at least let people opt out of different types of notifications.
au;1;Can’t getting through second time code very frustrating
au;1;It’s okay but there’s a black screen every few seconds that says “COVIDSafe”.
au;1;Stop trying to use download numbers to say how successful this app is. It doesn’t even work. No one is leaving it open and phone unlocked while going out. It’s actually useless and totally impractical
au;1;I keep getting messages to keep the app open even if it's on in the background. Clearly doesn't work properly on Apple devices.
au;4;Can you stop sending me notifications everyday asking me to keep Bluetooth on?
au;1;I keep getting a notification every morning to let me know it’s on! People will turn off notifications if you keep doing it, then when you really need to notify them about something important you won’t be able to.
au;1;Unfortunately can’t log in due to bug with phone number even though I am using the correct format the second time.
au;5;This app works fine on my phone, no battery drain and to be honest most times I forget it is there. If this helps end the lockdown by even 1 minute then it is worth it!
au;4;Don’t snitch on me guys lol
au;5;How come the wheel up the top of my iPhone screen is spinning for a while sometimes, since downloading the app? Is it because of background data being turned on? Also is there any way to have this app running and still have my low power mode setting on? I like saving battery power. Cheers
au;5;As soon as I downloaded this, Bill Gates appeared and tried to give me a vaccine without my permission.  Luckily my 5G protective suit saved me.
au;4;I think it’d be very handy if there was an option to view or check stats on “contact” data collected by the app. This would allow users to check for themselves if the app was actually working and/or how well it works with their iPhone locked in their pocket.
au;1;I downloaded the app and tried to put my details in but every 5 seconds the screen goes to black and it says “covidsafe” I tried restarting my phone and even deleting the app and re-downloading it but nothing worked. Probably just a glitch but it’s stopping me from registering.
au;5;Everyone get on board
au;5;I want to see my friends and family, hurry up and download.
au;3;I just want to go back to school and if this helps I’ll do it.
au;3;"...not very clear how it’s actually implemented. The notification sent every morning implies you need the app open on your screen to be effective. Why not take a little extra time to develop something that works in the background? Sure, millions might download, but if it’s a requirement to keep it open and few do, it’s not gonna help much.

Also, the daily notification is annoying. When I turned notifications off, the app implied it would no longer work without it. Want to help, but do I really need a notification every morning to do so?

Minus one star for each of the above, but 3 stars for: a simple on boarding process; a clean design; and for getting it out quickly. Hoping it still works in the background!"
au;3;My partner is from Canada, but cannot download the app. I'm sure there are thousands of other people in the same boat. Any way of making it available to all App Store regions?
au;3;Looks like the app is sleeping and/or switching off if it has not been in the foreground for a while.
au;2;"Whilst the app is an excellent idea the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.
The daily ‘alert’ messages which are just advertising were distracting and annoying.
I disabled alerts for the app and then the app said they are required.
There is no explanation why, and of course the government has gone back on its promise to open source the app and release an independent security audit report.
So thanks but no thanks."
au;1;"It has made me re-register a new account every day this week so clearly its stats about users are way out. I got fed up and deleted the ap. 
There is no place myself and my phone is going to be near anyone for 15 minutes so it's never going to measure anything of use."
au;5;There has never been a scenario like this since tech played such a part in our lives. Please get the app and make sure people who may get infected know about it!
au;1;"As reported by News.com.au and within the app itself, the app must be open with your screen turned on to track Contacts.

I can’t leave my phone unlocked whilst I’m roaming public places as this is specifically the time I want my phone protected by security.

The app constantly sends notifications asking to open the app and leave it in power save mode, for your reference, power save mode is when you open the app and place your phone either upside down or face down.

I’m really sad that iOS users aren’t able to reliably do our part to help!"
au;5;After researching privacy protection and against my very strong distrust of big government monitoring systems I decided to download the app. The installation was very easy n quick. Hopefully my decision was a correct one.
au;1;bad
au;3;Pretty sure it needs to be running in the foreground or at least reopened frequently to work, really annoying pop ups, would be better if it used the Apple API
au;3;If this app can be installed on smartwatches, it would be better. Some places don’t allow phones like certain workplaces. It is also better to run this app on the background in smartwatches.
au;1;"I've deleted this junk app. It doesn't function correctly. I don't want notifications on, period! Bluetooth Sharing is a security risk, like writing your password down on paper and putting it on display in a public place. Other apps have been able to successfully implement ""Background App Refresh"" without the app having to be open, or running in the tray. Many times I've left the house or gone to the shops, I always forget to make sure it's running, mainly because it's not an app I actively use. Set and Forget would be best for this app to function. Apple have integrated Covid-19 support in an upcoming update which therefore make this app redundant. There is a slim chance you will find this working when passing another person with it running as you've designed."
au;1;What good is the app if someone is active with the virus and they don’t use the app, then the app is useless
au;1;An absolutely useless app that doesn’t work unless you walk around with your phone unlocked and the app open. Counting download rates doesn’t count the apps effectiveness.
au;3;iOS implementation is poor - the app needs to run in the background once installed and not shut off when inadvertently closed down...
au;1;"I don’t like that I am asked to provide my name and contact number to sign up.
Why can’t they just alert me through the app rather than contacting me via phone?"
au;4;Every day! The app annoys me by saying “We need you” I downloaded the app so I’d be advised if I’d been in contact with someone who had the virus but the daily message is really annoying especially as, when I go in to the app, it says “you don’t need to do anything else”. Developers please note- if you continue to annoy me I will delete the app. EDIT - ok, I get it now. You open the app & leave it open. The Bluetooth is only active if your phone is unlocked & by opening the app, your phone won’t auto-lock after 5 minutes (or whatever your setting is). But if it sends me another message tomorrow ........
au;1;This app isn’t developed properly it has flaws such as black screen popping up ever few seconds saying covidsafe, text messages not coming through, logins constantly.
au;5;Wouldn’t send a pin at first because I had the wifi on using my home internet but once I turned wifi off the setup was easy.
au;3;The app is currently only available in the AU store.  However, with the many international students and migrants in Australia who are still in their original country’s store, there is no way for them to access and download the app, even if they wanted to. Might be worth making the app available in all international stores.
au;5;Download and protect Australia - it’s as simple as that!
au;1;Please STOP sending daily reminders to leave Bluetooth on
au;5;no problems with download and install to iphone 8+
au;3;I just downloaded it and everything but I found that anytime my phone is close to me the screen for the app blacks out and just has “COVIDSafe” in the middle. I moved the screen away and then it went back to normal, it’s like every time it’s facing me it’s “COVIDSafe” but then I tilt it slightly and it has the app working. Don’t know if this just glitch or feature of the app.
au;1;I am using this on my new iPad as I don’t use a smartphone. Not sure what the problem is but every morning the app is asking me to input my information and register again even though I successfully registered and got the screen saying I do not need to do anything further. I am not sure how, but eventually if I close the app a few times and reopen it, it gives me the screen showing I am already registered and the pulsating shield screen. If this keeps happening I will delete it in a few days. Can’t find anywhere to send feedback to directly, or get any support so I hope someone is reading these feedbacks. The APP SUPPORT BUTTON just takes you to a faq page with no contact details re: the app so that is useless. Also the frequent notifications about running the app are pointless and really annoying. This was obviously a rush job stupidly.
au;4;I understand the need for this app but it seems a little pointless. As I’m as hearing to the social distancing regulations the only people who I’m ever in contact with for more than 15 minutes are the people in my house. The most likely place I’m going to contact this virus is while shopping and the people I pass in the shops won’t be registered. The serving problem with it is Bluetooth which I need to remember to turn on when I leave the house but turn off at home or my phone automatically connects to random home devices.
au;1;"If indeed the contact tracing works best (or maybe only) when the app is open on the screen and the screen unlocked (and my phone did not automatically lock after the set time when this was the case and I wasn’t holding it)  then the battery will drain very quickly and it’s also a major security risk if we   lose sight of our phones for a moment or more. 
Running as a background app would make much more sense. 
Also conflicting information has been given re running the app in power saver mode or not."
au;1;"Why does the app keep sending a notification 3-4 a day telling me to keep Bluetooth on when is already turned on? 

Very annoying. Now turning the notifications for it OFF!"
au;3;The only notifications the app sends me seem to imply that I’ve turned it off. But it’s always on except in one situation. When I’m with a client trying to take a payment using the Square payment app, I have to close COVIDSafe because it causes the Bluetooth card reader to lose contact. And that’s about the only situation when I’m anywhere near anyone outside my family, so it loses its usefulness.
au;4;Notifications keep popping up telling me to turn on Bluetooth and have the app running in the background - when I have done both already and am using the app correctly. This is annoying and may result in people deleting the app from frustration.
au;1;I am getting logged out every single night as is my mother who lives miles away from me. We both have left it running in the background with Bluetooth turned on and are finding each morning asking use to use the APP. What are we doing wrong?
au;5;Although I’m not sold on this helping as much as they claim but we gotta try. I mean we’ve all sold our backsides to google, Facebook etc already. This app collects less data that those so although Im big on privacy, I can’t argue against this whilst still using google and Facebook. Which I do. Let’s beat the damn rona!!!!
au;3;Are you looking into the API from Apple and Google so that the app can work more natively with iOS?
au;5;Stay home, stay safe
au;1;I have downloaded the app and all I see is the black screen that says “COVIDSafe”. When I try to switch apps the screen with the explanations appears but when I go back to the app the black screen is still there and it doesn’t let me select any options or proceed. Basically I cannot use the app. I have tried closing and opening the app but still the same black “COVIDSafe” screen that doesn’t let me do anything.
au;2;Won’t go past the home screen - quickly flickers to the next screen and then crashes. iPhone X with updated iOS
au;1;"Sunday:
Error verifying mobile number!  

Number was entered correctly (with and without leading 0)

Monday to Thursday:
A couple of times per day, I’m asked to run the app in background 

Today, it asks me to turn on Bluetooth.  I must have amazing AirPods because I had been and continued to listen to podcasts before, during and after this alert. 

I hope the next iteration addresses this annoyance. 

Also, I’d like some indication it’s functioning as designed either by being able to list detections or a display of the detection count."
au;3;This morning I was using my iPhone 6 and Apple ear buds on Bluetooth to listen to the radio.  Of the ten people who passed by my buds/phone cut out five times as we crossed.  Could only put it down to app pinging?
au;3;After some install hassles it now appears to be working.
au;1;"Unable to register onto this app. It has constantly rejected my access code -037086. 

It referred me back to the system administrator. I have been trying to do so.
Every time I try to reregister I don’t get a new access code number. When I use the only number applied I get rejected and told to try again.

Just too too frustrating."
au;4;"This is a great app with a brilliant concept but I’m unable to multitask on my phone and still have it tracking; it doesn’t track while the app isn’t open. Would be awesome to have as a constant background tracker and be able to work with my phone locked in my pocket."
au;5;Easy to install and it seems to work as it should 👍🏼
au;1;"Had to disable notifications because it kept sending me daily alerts telling me to use the app... Which I was.

App now won't work with notifications disabled so thinking I may as well uninstall. Now won't show anything but a prompt to enable notifications again."
au;4;Overall works fine but keeps disrupting my AirPods when listening to music which is annoying because when I’m out it’s the only time when I use them and, at the same time, it is critical that the app keeps connected. Please look into it, as others are also experiencing the same issue.
au;1;I’ve downloaded, deleted and downloaded again on a number of seperate occasions and I still can’t get past the mobile phone number verification stage
au;2;Not impressed with the app when u have to keep the Bluetooth on and if u turn it off it keeps reminding you to turn it back on. Doesn’t really tell you where or whom who has it
au;2;Titles says it, app will make you sign up again every few days. Unsure wether it’s actually doing any tracking while it’s offline but seems a bit pointless me needing to signup again so often. If the app developers can’t figure out how to save a login token on a device I doubt their ability to securely store peoples sensitive data.
au;5;this is a perfect app and safe to use!
au;5;"Will help us all get back to normal soon if  all Australians download this App without worrying about battery life, privacy issues
I found it has very little battery drain and certainly fell safer shopping 
DOWNLOAD TODAY"
au;1;App won’t accept a valid phone number when registering. Cannot use app at all.
au;5;"This is a great app. The more people download it, the sooner we’ll be back to normal. 

My only issue is that it’s only available in the Australian App Store. I have friends who are expats living in Australia who want to download the app but are unable to because they still use the global/another country’s App Store. This is much like the people in Australia without Australian mobile numbers. If both of these things could be fixed, that’d be helpful.

I wonder if the developers could maybe just geofence Australia and then open the app for everyone to use?

Just a thought."
au;3;I went out to the shops yesterday and my iPhone 8 was flat by the time I was having an X-ray. So the issue is battery life.
au;1;It keeps asking me for my information eveytime I open the app
au;2;The idea of this app is great. But only if it can actually work. I’ve spent 10 minutes on this app already and haven’t even got to the “I consent” button because it keeps glitching out to the “COVIDSafe” black screen...?
au;3;"The Singapore version of this app requires it to be kept in the foreground and says that. This version says ‘open’ and the minister has said it has fixed the problems that require foreground. 

Can we get an answer as to if it needs to be in the foreground to work?"
au;5;"I installed the app, it was easy to install and seems working OK but since the app doesn’t give live feedback to the user due to the privacy of other users, there is no practical way to know if it is working as it should be. 

My main concern and suggestion is that it only works on the phone and not on the watch. Phones are not easy to sanitise each time you go out and come back that is why, whenever I go grocery shopping i only have my Apple Watch with me since I can have my calls, texts and payments with it and I can wash it while washing my hands when I come home. Therefore my phone shows no contact with anyone."
au;1;Download app ok, register details ok, but the approval to upload info won’t work. It states that a sms with number would be sent to my phone but does not happen. What to do?
au;1;"Asks me to sign up again every morning. Gets tiring after a couple of days. 
iPhone 11 Pro 13.4.1
Why can’t we simply use the Apple/google developed API
Goodbye app. Delete."
au;4;Easy app to install but I am getting a notification every day telling me to keep it open and running in background. Issue is - I am receiving this notification when it is open! Please only trigger this when it isn’t open if you can!
au;3;Why do I need a notification every day to tell me to keep it on. I have now turned off notifications so hopefully it still works. I do shift work so a reminder at 9am is a fail.
au;1;Look, I really want to help stop the spread and I really don't mind having the app installed and running but I've uninstall coz I'm fken sick and tired of the spammy notifications every single day. Get rid of this bloatware.
au;4;App open and running and twice a day I’m getting an alert to open the app and turn my Bluetooth on. It is open and it is on. An important app we should all have but stop beating us over the head with it when we’re already doing the right thing.
au;1;"It continues to ask me to re-register.

Have submitted a support email and just get automated responses.

One more useless app destined to be uninstalled."
au;3;I downloaded and set up the app about 3 days ago and it was running fine, but this morning it made me set it up again. If this happens every few days it will get annoying and also is a risk that the app can’t fulfill its function properly if users have to re-enter their details every few days. Hopefully it was just a one off!
au;3;App doesn’t seem to be working in the background, as I keep receiving reminders about it.
au;1;"It asking me to register every day, I enter my details...

I’ve emailed you as to what you mean by keep the app open when out

WhT do you mean???? Load it and leave it on the screen? It’s installed, surely that’s what you mean, when I’m out, I’m using my phone

I emailed this question to you 3 days ago and just had a generic useless reply on the quick reference guide which doesn’t clarify this question

I don’t see the point of it, currently it’s not working until I register my details again, 4th day in a row

I think I’ll just delete it..."
au;2;This app can only be used by Iphones 6 and newer. Any one with an older Iphone cannot use it. If you want more people to use the app create an app for older phones.
au;3;This may turnout to be pointless if you don’t allow for additional tracking. Many people would gladly give their location details if you let them. Appeasing the privacy lobbyists is fine but obviously if the modelling shows 40% of the population need the app to be effective then over 70% of smartphones users need the app, 3 million is nowhere near enough. Allowing people to volunteer their information will make it more effective, it wouldn’t be a difficult program change. Please let people help.
au;4;More reliable than Barnaby Joyce’s condoms in the secretary’s office.
au;5;"For the non-tech ppl, it is a small app only 12.5MB 🧐I hope our small contribution here truly helps us all.
Also note you cannot add an emoji to your ‘Firstname Surname’ field when registering your details in the app, you’ll get a false error that your number couldn’t be verified."
au;1;I tried downloading and registering but when I open the app the screen just keeps flashing from the register screen to a black screen that says covidsafe. It’s making it hard to read and put in my details as it just keeps flashing between two screens.
au;5;"Install this app is less about me, more for others, it’s about reducing risks to my family and friends. When I get informed being under the risk, I can immediately avoid meeting others to make sure they are safe. If I do it for you, can you do it for your loved ones.

The app itself only requests phone Num, post code and age range. This is less than any services I sign up these days. I’m sure Gov knows more about me than these 3 things. It’s not tracking location either, it only cares about if any identified case around you so they can contact you. The virus is so aggressive, without using technology what’s our way out?"
au;5;"No issues to date with this app. Drop the leading 0 on your phone number if you’re having issues with setup. No noticeable difference on battery either. Works fine with a locked screen. It’s pretty much set and forget, just leave Bluetooth on.
If people are having issues try turning your phone “off” then “on” again."
au;1;Have to sign up every time you start the app. This will get tiresome quickly.
au;1;After starting app the screen goes dark with COVIDsafe text in the middle.
au;5;Downloaded very straight forward. Having trouble with blue tooth as keeps disconnecting when phone goes to sleep.Allow Bluetooth remains off with no ability to switch this on via app. So don’t think my app is functioning. There is no real help/troubleshooting available for the app. So have given up. I did give high rating because the concept is good!
au;5;We need to encourage as many of our friends and family to down load this App and as responsible Australia’s it’s all for one and one for all.... I have seen the best and worst in people during this pandemic we all need to accept that the world is going to be a different place when this is all over and realise that our government is doing this to keep us safe it’s not espionage it’s not some sort of conspiracy...Take  Care Everyone and Stay Healthy
au;3;So I like the idea  of this app but it sends you a notification if your Bluetooth happens to drop our reminding you to check that it’s connected! Kind of annoying especially if it happens daily. Also it would be great if it linked with the other gov one so it recognises that you already have the alert app active!
au;3;I think 1.5m doesn’t seem enough. If you put your phone on a bench it’s not going to be very accurate. It’s ok if you have your phone on your body all the time. Still confused on when the app works or not if the screen is unlocked or locked and whether it’s just the app remaining in the background 🤷🏻‍♀️
au;1;Have iPhone X, won’t verify my phone number have tried numerous times.  Have deleted app and reloaded , turned off wifi etc NOTHING Works!
au;1;I was really looking forward to helping by using this app, but for the third time this week is is asking me to sign up. I did, and it forgot - so I did it again and now it’s asking again. That 3 times in 3 days. Twice it also reminded me to open it even though it was running in the background. I don’t think it’s working.
au;1;I cannot get the app to recognise my phone number - tried everything. Hopeless.
au;1;Tried to set this app up but can’t activate because we do not have mobile phone reception.
au;5;Works as intended.  Recommended!
au;5;"Turn off WiFi and the app will verify. 
It would have been nice if the app developers had advised of this problem. 
App works well."
au;5;How lucky are we to live in Australia And to have an App like this for the health and safety of all of us is amazing. We should all be grateful that we don’t live in the USA or anywhere else at the moment. 🇦🇺 Thank you 🙏🏼
au;1;Have tried this app on my phone with and without the leading 0 and it declines my number every time. It’s a case of i can see the need for the app and want to use it but my number just does not work. 1 star till it’s fixed
au;5;Was Super easy to download and register. Hope all individuals download the app for the benefit of all!
au;5;"Never has there been a more important time or technological tool that can make a real difference to your community.

Whilst it is reasonable to ask questions about privacy and security, these have been answered comprehensively in the affirmative.

This is not a time for ideology or a contrarian view, merely for the sake of it. It is a time for practicality and pragmatism.

Do your civic duty; DOWNLOAD IT, enter your details and you’ll be helping to protect yourself and your loved ones and potentially helping to ease social restrictions ASAP."
au;2;Sign up details required every time I open the app? Giving up using it as its like I have to sign up as a new user every time!!
au;3;"I really want this to work well. I really do. But there are 2 main issues.
1. Remembering to activate it when you go out.
2. You then can’t use your phone to answer calls, reply to messages, use Wallet to pay for things, etc.

I realise that having an app with BLE running in the background is not allowed with Apple but this really needs to be escalated quickly to ensure this app can be used effectively."
au;5;Works the goods
au;5;If you want to get out of lockdown quicker and get back to normal life quicker, just download the app. You are helping not only yourself but other people. If you are worried about being “tracked” you are likely being tracked already from the social media apps you use
au;4;Yeah the fourth level where you use the sniper rifle on the terrorist is tough
au;1;Unable to register iPhone 5 & 6 running ios12. Unable to verify phone numbers. Let’s compare #downloads with registrations.
au;1;Mobile hot spot not available or interference while using this app forced me to delete it.
au;1;"I really want to download to do my part, however, like I’m sure many people (and everyone IN Australian territories with a smart phone should be using this atm) I don’t have an Australian mobile number. It is essential that you update this app so it doesn’t have to be a +61 number to active it and it can be activated with ANY mobile number attached to a smart phone. You are failing the full potential of this app and the health of everyone in Australia if you don’t do so. 

Please amend ASAP and release an inclusive update. Please also release an immediate statement addressing this."
au;5;Installation and registration fine / no issues on iPhone X. It would be good if the user themselves could get stats / feedback such as number of interactions with other people with the app / how close you were to another user and how long. Just so you know it is working properly and can also make sure you can adjust your social distancing if required etc. apart from that everyone should download, privacy reasons touted by some are nonsense. Google, Apple, FB and the ATO have way for info on you so stop worrying
au;3;I like the idea of this app, however I had it open in the background and it only ran for 1 minute before stopping (according to the log in settings).
au;5;Great to see the app has attracted over 2m downloads within 3 days since the launch. Given it has passed the Privacy Impact Assessment and received full endorsement from OAIC, I’m encouraging everyone to do our bits in securing the wellbeing of our people and communities by installing this app. #We’reAllInThis2gether
au;5;A bit confident now to get outside home.
au;2;This app drained my battery so quickly, my phone only lasted a few hours before the battery was flat.
au;5;Australia won’t be bullied. Big local economic recovery coming soon thanks
au;5;Even if you can’t find the app if you get someone to send it to you it works just as well but you have to have apple store or google or something else play but really good and easy
au;2;I keep getting notifications for no reason with no value to them. I’ve already downloaded it but it seems it wants to keep sending me notices for no reason
au;1;The download of app has been stuck at a point for me. I started download of app and it got stuck due to no disk space on my phone. Now I have cleared some files to make space but it won’t start downloading again and is stuck. I can’t stop and restart the download
au;1;Can’t get pass verify stage because of the same issue assent others
au;1;Downloaded the app no problems. Today I received a notification so I opened the app to see what it was. The notification said I had tested positive for COVID-19 and asked  me to tick a box to consent to the release of my data. Lol. I haven’t even been tested let alone tested positive. Nor do I know anyone who has been tested. I searched around for a phone number to report the problem but all I could find was the Coronavirus hotline number. I called this number to report the problem but they didn’t have an answer. All they could do was give me an email address for app support. So if I wanted to report this problem I would have to send an email, thus giving them more of my data. I just deleted the app instead.
au;5;Just download and use it - Save our health system and your love one
au;4;"I have only one issues with thie covidsafe app. 
So if you are driving in your car and behind the red light others have this app in their cars and you know Bluetooth on phones can pick each others even from different cars in 10 m distance. 

If one of  people in other cars gets possitive result, Am I gonna get notifications to quarantine myself? 

Especially gov claims that they don’t use your location so they don't know you were at a road!!!"
au;5;It is good to know how many people has installed this app so far.
au;2;"I willingly downloaded the app, I’ve kept it running in the background, and I have Bluetooth on. Please stop sending me alerts every day asking for my help when that’s exactly what I’m doing. 

The quickest way to make me delete the app is to keep these daily alerts. Give me the option to turn them off!"
au;4;I am trying my best to get people on board to install this App but for the life of me I cannot see anyway to ring an expert etc
au;1;I am finding the app is running my battery down very quickly.
au;1;Today there was a msg on my screen when I opened my phone, saying “We have reset you..” but blinked off before I could read the rest. The app is now not operating properly, and not showing info long enough to read anything. I deleted and reinstalled it but no success. It was fine since installing initially until today.  NOW, its wanting a nickname and telling me all my choices are taken! Surely the review is more important than a nickname!!!
au;2;"Notifications every morning at 9am that are what, “friendly reminders”? It’s already on and in background. Only notify me if something is wrong, or I need to do something.

The annoy factor is huge if you’re just notifying me for nothing. I leave it on in background 24/7 (same with Bluetooth) so is it having a problem, or just being a bother?"
au;3;"I really want to do my part in helping the community recover/move past this horrid COVID situation but our furry friends in the federal government have half assed this app.  Requiring it to be permanently open defeats the purpose of facilitating contact tracing (a critical element of  from being safe to reduce the need for social distancing).  By all accounts there was a better, more functional and to be frank socio-literate app platform which was rejected for reasons only the government boffins know.  

Making it harder to maintain useful functionality ain’t the smart move."
au;2;Every morning I get a notification to register my details and create a profile. Not sure if this is because I turn my phone off over night, but it’s very annoying!
au;1;"I enabled notifications so I could be notified in case I have C19, but notifications pop up to tell me to turn Bluetooth on and it’s already on
So I’m turning off notifications, I might as well delete the app 
- let me give you a heads up, people DONT want useless notifications on their phones popping up interrupting !!
Knock it off bozos !"
au;3;If you keep pissing off the public with your spam notifications they’ll just uninstall the app and you’re back to square one.
au;5;"Can you please stop the annoying ‘We need you..’ message that comes up every second day. 

I get it - the app is working in the background as requested and I take my phone everywhere. I just don’t need the reminder telling me to do what I’m already doing."
au;4;"I’m feeling a little bit safer for having this app as I travel on public transport to and from work - providing the people I’m travelling with have it too... Good job on the government getting this going, it’s a great initiative if we’re wanting our lives to return to normal. For all those people concerned about the government knowing where you are, it doesn’t track your location!! This is proven by the app not asking for access to location services. 

I’m an IT professional and fully support it. Everyone should do their bit and get it."
au;5;"For once, it’s great to see all government agencies working together here to provide information across the board.   There is information from the ATO, Centrelink, health, people experiencing hardship etc etc 

Good work!"
au;4;Been trying for two days to activate but get continual error about being unable to verify phone number. No other details , no support contact so have reluctantly had to give up
au;1;Shuts down even if left in the background, after a few hours. So if you are out at work or wherever, you have to keep checking on it. Its ridiculous.
au;1;Bravo! An app that only works only on the latest phones running latest OS. Whoever put this together is blind to the lived experience of the elderly and the not-so-well off. Even in a pandemic our governing elites are happy to leave 20% of their fellow Australians behind.
au;5;"Just download it and stop being paranoid.
The sooner we do everything asked of us, the sooner we can get back to normality."
au;5;"How important is the life of you, your parents, your children, your partner?

Is privacy more important than potentially saving a life?

Is privacy more important than getting Australia back on its feet and saving people’s jobs?

There is a reason I am using this app to save the life of myself and others"
au;5;No problem. Easy to install. No privacy concerns. Glad to do my bit for ridding our country of this virus. :)
au;1;Unfortunately the app won’t let me sign up due to my phone number ‘being incorrect’. I’ve tried deleting and redownloading the app but it still shows up with the same message. I’ve tried inputting my phone number as an 04... number as well as a 4... I’d be more than willing to download the app to save lives but unfortunately it’s not letting me download it properly :/
au;5;"It’s new but I feel safer knowing that if someone tests positive to COVID that I will be informed.
It works via Bluetooth and to be honest I don’t feel like my privacy is compromised. This could change but I take the risk with everything online that I do, so to save lives why not jump on the bandwagon!"
au;2;Unable to complete registration despite following instructions unable to go back to see if information entered correct unable to request new PIN number to verify phone number
au;5;Such a brilliant idea. I’m very keen on this app. I just hope that it‘s working well with apple phones.
au;2;"Why must I leave the app open?  Other Bluetooth applications work in background mode.  
Too many pop up messages makes this app very annoying"
au;5;“ItS gOiNg To TrAcK mY lOcAtIoN” “I dOnT wAnT tHe GoVeRnMeNt FoLlOwInG mY mOvEmEnTs” - said every halfwit on Facebook comments section. I’m still waiting for one of these armchair tech geniuses to tell me how an app that doesn’t even request location services can track me. Furthermore why are they so paranoid? Have they seen government spies hiding in their front garden lately or something? Look Karen I don’t think they could care less what you do so why would they want to track you. This app is great. Uses little battery and mobile data. The more downloads there are, the faster we’ll get out of our homes and the sooner lives get back to normal. It’ll tell you if you’ve bumped into someone with the virus to protect you and your family too. Just download the damn app.
au;3;I couldn’t verify my mobile number until I was using mobile data.  Others in my household also had the same issue until wifi was turned off on devices.
au;4;"Took me the best part of 24 hours to get the PIN number to verify my phone but got there in the end. My guess is was just due to the volume of people down loading and trying to sign up.

Hopefully we get enough people doing it and we can get back to normal sooner"
au;5;Please, do this? I have 3 very vulnerable people in my family. We can protect others and we will be better off sooner then others.  Be the wave of love and be the country who remains a n their heart space.
au;2;It’s been just 24 hrs since downloading this app and so far I cannot have another app running properly with on average it shutting down within minutes.  I want to do the right thing having this running but it’s driving me nuts!
au;5;This is one step to reducing the spread of covid -19 and I am happy to use this application knowing the safety of my data and l knowing I am working with many other Australians to prevent the spread that will undoubtedly safe lives.
au;5;Help each other, help our community.
au;5;Great idea. Glad to play my part.
au;5;This app is really helpful and easy to use
au;1;Downloaded it, worked fine for a day. Then started to flash on and off.  Then it froze, along with my phone. Deleted it!!
au;5;Works well. Happy to use this and help watch the Covid numbers go down. Let’s do our bit and save lives and get the pubs open safely again!
au;3;This is a great initiative to see from the government. As a developer I know that there are tools from Apple being made available to make sure this app can run in the background, this app really needs to make use of them to make sure that this app is as effective as it can be
au;1;Understand the need for this app, but it is a killer on the battery. Can’t be doing a whole lot of tracking if your battery is flat on the way home from work. Needs to be revisited by app designers.
au;1;"Get an error. 
Able to download 
The app fails to send an OTP sms to validate my number."
au;1;Would not recommend
au;2;"I was happy to comply with health department efforts but I think my phone is too old; the app seemed to drain the battery on my ancient iPhone 5S from 50% to 0 in about 10 minutes. I had to delete it."
au;5;Don’t see the reason why I shouldn’t download this app! Some say the government are going to monitor what I do and I reply, I have no fear for that unless I am dodgy
au;5;Smart fantastic way of keeping us safe !
au;5;Personal freedom and liberty is only up to the lowest denominator. Don’t be the lowest denominator and download the app.
au;1;App keeps telling me that Bluetooth is off even though it is switched on and active. My other Bluetooth devices are working fine, so it isn’t a phone problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail.
au;1;"This app will only work if the phone’s unlocked and the app is running.

It does nothing if the app is running in background mode."
au;5;I’m a doctor working in an ED of a public hospital. With so many asymptomatic cases spreading the virus to vulnerable members of our community, I’d like to thank you for this initiative to use our technology to save lives through a simple app download. And thank you to everyone who downloads the app and participates. We’re stronger together, Australia! Keep up the good work!
au;1;Sadly the app ‘for the country’ does not work on phones running older iOS versions. Not everyone can afford the latest and greatest phone on the market.
au;3;Does app still work if my phone has turn off background refresh and this app is runining but run in the background?
au;1;"This app is junk. All I get is ""error verifying phone number”. I’ve tried turning wifi, Bluetooth and mobile data off and I have a valid phone number. Disappointing that such an important project has been implemented so poorly."
au;5;Anything that can help is a positive
au;5;Turn off wifi to receive activation code.
au;5;It’s our 20-29 yo most likely to contract/carry covid 19! Yet this age group seems more opposed to being tracked. I suggest all parents really sit down and discuss what it means for the community and their family and encourage them to download - hey if it means we lift restrictions quicker better for all!
au;1;"Turn WiFi OFF to register and leave out the leading 0 for your phone number, should load straight away.

Just imagine how many installations have been missed out on because of this issue."
au;5;This is one of the easiest things Australian’s can do to secure our nation and prevent future outbreaks. This will allow us to start easing restrictions.
au;5;Promising app. Great to see 2.4 million people have downloaded.
au;5;"And was told to... “Please keep Bluetooth and Notifications enabled.”

No problems registering, ensure Bluetooth and mobile data is active before the registration process. I used 0 preceding my number even though (+61) was indicated in the process. 

I think once I’m home that there is no point keeping it running as I think this will use battery life, however I usually turn Bluetooth off when at home to save power unless I’m forwarding picture to my spouse via AirPlay.  Just have to remember to activate COVIDSafe each time I leave home, so...

I’ve set a reminder when a particular location has been determined, such as “Getting in my car”, when my Bluetooth connects to my car the alert will remind me to turn on COVIDSafe."
au;5;"It had some issues when it launched but it works fine now.

It’s not perfect but it’s what we got. Let’s try to make this work."
au;5;This app will save lives IF and only IF the government adds EVERYONE who tests (or has already tested) positive to it. Without this information it won’t work. Please make it law, punishable by a large fine.
au;1;Needs improvement with SMS confirmation
au;3;We are senior pensioners. My husband cannot download this app because he only has IOS 10.3.4 which is the max his IPhone will take. I’m sure he won’t be the only Australian with an older phone which we have no need to replace
au;5;"Extremely straightforward to install.  Very easily understood privacy policy.  My RACQ app takes more personal and location data than this.

Drop your mobile number ‘0’, per every other comment on here.

It’ll save lives."
au;4;This is a great idea and I really want to use it, I don’t care about all the tinfoil hat wearing people who want to complain about privacy, I care only about battery life of my phone, this app Is like a virus for your iPhone, due to a bad battery I have the obsessive compulsive need to close all apps before putting the phone back in my pocket! 🤷‍♂️
au;5;Super easy app to download, but the verification code SMS took over half an hour to appear. Leave out the “0” when putting in your mobile phone number, and be patient!
au;1;Anytime I put my mobile number in it tells me it cannot verify. Help!
au;1;Downloaded the app on iPhone8 but when I open it the front page appears for 1/2 second then goes to a black screen with COVID-19. Cant even get to the questions!
au;2;Very easy to setup but drained the power very quickly. Have turned it off while at home until it’s fixed.
au;5;It is a very basic app and easy questions to answer . They are not interested in your personal information . It is designed to help us all snd as Australians I’m sure we won’t our life back 🥇
au;3;Great app, important, but it’s hammering the battery.
au;1;We still haven’t seen the official release of the source code of this app. Concerned about the horrible track record of this government on digital privacy violations.
au;5;Great app. Works well. Get tracking and tracking so we can go back to work!
au;1;"Re install the application twice still can’t get PIN for the mobile phone.  Try both with and without leading zero for my phone no.

Disappointing!

At the end,  I noticed my phone is on WiFi call as my mobile carrier is the same as the NBN at home.  Do I turned off my phone WiFi and ask for the pin again.  Then it works.  May be the software needs to work with WiFi phone at home."
au;5;Download the app. It could save someone’s life.
au;4;It would be so much more effective if it worked on Apple Watch. I don’t always have my phone with me when I’m out, usually because I forget it, but always wear my watch.
au;5;Download this app to help stop the spread of COVID-19
au;1;"I have to reregister every morning?. Was it designed to do that, and not save my info? 

Will quickly tire of that!"
au;5;Just keeps a list of the phones you were near in the last 3 weeks using Bluetooth.  Only uploads if you tell it to. If we can trace all the contacts of people who get the virus we can beat this.
au;5;"It took less than 30 seconds to download, get the pin and set up on my phone.  To the double digit IQs that say they can’t get a pin, remove the ‘0’ from the front of your mobile number.

I’m not crazy about supplying this information to the government, or anyone else for that matter, but I think this is one of those times we have to use reason and work together to end this."
au;5;Everyone needs to install this app.
au;3;Keep notifications to a minimum: no political or nagging spamming, please. If you exceed your limits I’ll switch notification off altogether.
au;1;"Requires a phone no.... tells me my number is an error.
Same for my wife"
au;2;"Finally figured it out
This error message is returned if you have not read the privacy disclosure"
au;4;If you need us, the users, to leave notifications turned on, STOP WITH THE DAILY SPAM NOTIFICATIONS!!! Don’t piss off your users!
au;1;I am a community RN and were asked to download app. Accidentally type my personal number instead of my work phone where I downloaded this app. The code was sent to my personal phone and absent mindedly used the code to verify. Realising my mistake, I have downloaded the app on my personal phone. I went through the “enter pin” and would not send me one to verify. Clicked resend but nothing happened. Maybe an issue with using multiple device.
au;1;"This app will not work as intended if you use your phone for *anything* else.
Take a call? It stops working.
Check your messages? It stops working.
DHHS need to support Apple and Googles Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing ASAP if they really want to protect Australians from COVID-19."
au;5;Setup took less than a minute. The app itself is very polished and I haven’t noticed any loss of battery with it running in the background.
au;1;This app doesn’t even recognise my mobile phone number.  I have no faith the app will work.  Plus app would let negative reviews through
au;2;Great idea, great simple concept for the app however at this stage for my phone the app will ask again for my details / ‘sign up’ after a day or so.
au;1;"As a supermarket worker I thought, this is a great idea , stick phone in my pocket on silent and leave it, downloaded and set it up with no problems , went to work and it used all my battery :( 
I have Had iPhones for a long time and have NEVER EVER had my phone go flat. Sorry scomo deleting now , let me know when it’s fixed"
au;1;"Easily downloaded the app. But does not acknowledge my name.
&  Mobile no and won’t give me a PIN"
au;1;I want to take part, but like others I can’t get past the validation of phone number screen. Have left off zero, deleted app and retried....still no joy.
au;1;Can’t seem to text me the code to sign up. Would love to help. But app doesn’t work.
au;1;"I’m running latest version of iOS apple 8 phone.
Tried every variation of my number and tried and waited a couple of times (congestion), still could send pin to verify my number.

Sorry fellas, the easiest part seems like the hardest. Good luck getting to 40%"
au;1;Wouldn’t accept my phone number. I thought it was just me, but then it wouldn’t accept my wife’s as well.
au;1;"Sadly this app will not work for those who have an older phone. 
If it’s running on less than the iOS 10 you can not install it.   
Disappointing."
au;1;"The app won’t recognise my details, phone number and can’t send me a pin to register.
I’m trying to do the right thing by registering but when you get error messages, makes it hard."
au;2;"Tried 30+ times over two days to try and register the app. It kept telling me that there was a problem with the phone number I was entering. Same issue for both numbers I entered (dual sim phone). As a last resort I disconnected from my wifi and tried and it registered immediately. 

The instructions need to specify that the phone cannot be on wifi to register."
au;1;Get as far as muting my mob in, but do not get a pin, yes tried leaving off the Zero at the start and leaving it on! Still nothing
au;1;I entered my mobile number and it refused to send me a PIN, I tried again removing the zero at front, and eventually got the PIN, entered the PIN, and it timed out over the 5 minutes not accepting the PIN. Please try harder.
au;1;I can’t get a pin sent to be able to use this app.
au;1;The mobile number I currently have is the first and only mobile number I’ll ever have. Why isn’t it being accepted, and who puts +61 in front of a mobile number unless they’re calling from overseas?
au;1;This app keeps suggesting I have an invalid mobile number. I have used two versions the international version and the in country version. Both have been rejected by the sign on for the app.
au;2;I tried last night & again this morning. Just sits there trying to send a pin....
au;1;I have repeatedly tried to download this app every thing is fine until I try to put my mobile number in, tried with the 0 and without, will not recognise either, so it’s a no go for me I’m afraid.
au;3;Tell people upfront they need to turn wifi off to initiate the app
au;1;My husband and I have tried loading the app on numerous occasions over the last two days - we cannot get a verification number.  This is useless!!
au;5;Turn off your phone wifi and it will work
au;4;Easy to set up except for it not accepting mobile number. I left the 0 off the beginning of number as suggested below in a review but still didn’t work. I noted I was on wifi so I then changed to using mobile data along with leaving 0 off number. This worked. All the best everyone and take care.
au;1;Tried many times (apple phone) but it said 'unable to verify your number'. Finally found the solution - turn off wifi, registers instantly.
au;1;A really important initiative I support and encourage all to use however, failed to be able to verify phone number of mobile I’ve been using for 10 years plus. Dropped 0 and added 0 (due +61) but no joy. Appreciate advice on issue or fix. Also, if it makes a difference to loading app, the + 61 will confuse those who haven’t travelled overseas previously which could delay / stop sign ups. Suggest ‘Help Tip’ on this point. Keep up the good work everyone.
au;1;I was so willing to help but I downloaded app 24 hrs ago and cannot login. Keep getting mobile not verified. I’m in my 60’s and at risk. Want to do eve to help but app not works for me
au;2;Great idea but despite repeated tries, deleting and reinstalling, verification of my phone number hasn’t worked.
au;1;"All data is subject to US laws under the CLOUD Act - Which allows them access to our data since it is stored on a US based companies servers (Amazon) 
Would of made more sense to have this hosted securely on an Australian Network. 
Deleting the app and letting everyone know."
au;4;Found that I needed to turn my wifi off for the pin to come through and get past the phone number stage. Just for anyone that may be having issues.
au;1;I have been trying to set this up on my phone since it was released.   I get to the screen where I put my phone number in (without the zero) then they only option I have is to click on ‘get PIN’.   Nothing happens, just the wheel keeps spinning.   I’ve walked away and left it for ages, and go back and it has either timed out or the wheel is still spinning.    I have an iPhone 11 so phone shouldn’t be a problem.
au;5;Its just some simple steps thats not taking more than 1 min to register. And phone number definitely necessary for us to get contacted if we need to be. I really felt we should sacrifice a little of our privacy to let us get back to our normal life faster.
au;1;I don’t even get a PIN texted because of that issue
au;1;This is not an issue with the 0 at the start, as I have been trying without it. Even tried with it to be sure and it comes up with a different error. Lucky I have no job at the moment so I have time to waste on it 😏
au;5;"We need good contact tracing to reopen society, I’m very supportive of this apps purpose & keen that the target of 10 million people download this. 

To register, turn OFF WiFi. Don’t enter the leading zero of your mobile number."
au;1;Cannot verify my mobile number!!
au;1;I am unable to pass the point of registering my phone number, hoping this issue will be fixed soon. I have an iPhone 11, I have read there seems to be more issues with iPhones.
au;3;My wife and I both have iPhone 8’s on the same iOS.  Downloaded the app on my phone first go, worked like a charm.   But when we subsequently tried to download it to my wife’s phone, every time we typed in her number and requested a verification code, we got an error message.   Tried rebooting phone, deleting and reloading app, all to no avail.   Then found a clue on line.   We switched off wifi on wife’s phone, and were able to complete the installation process.   Anyone like to explain this problem?
au;1;The app is not verifying my number, tried it without the 0 because of the +61 and tried with the 0. A little bit frustrated with it.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled and still not accepting.
au;1;NEED TO TURN WIFI  OFF TO REGISTER PHONE NUMBER! Why isn’t this on the instructions! Have a multi sim iPhone with one an E-sim and the other a conventional sim. Doesn’t recognise either number using the international format (+61 and leaving out the 0).I thought it would have been tested or at least some technical troubleshooting directions could be supplied!!! After several attempts turned WIFI off and it worked.
au;3;Turn off your Wi-Fi, enter details and get a new pin - worked straight away, then turn your Wi-Fi back on..
au;1;Won’t allow me to activate it and get past the  loading of the phone number to generate the pin.
au;1;Went to download the app to do the right thing and have now been waiting over 24 hours for a 6 digit pin to verify phone number.... guess I’m not the only one so can only imagine how many COULD be registered if they had a working app
au;1;Each time I enter my phone number an error box comes up. Also the screen keeps going black with a Covid sign.
au;5;"Wouldn’t let me verify my mobile number at 1st. So for some of those having same trouble... 
I turned off my phones wifi, then it worked 👍"
au;3;Can’t get 6 digit pin code when I enter my mobile phone number... saying there is an error after it thinks for ages.
au;1;"I’ve downloaded the app which is fine, but why can’t I register my mobile number? Yes I’m dropping the first 0 and tried adding the first 0 but to no prevail. I understand 1.8million people have downloaded the app but how many have actually registered successfully?
Any assistance would be great to register as I want to do my bit!"
au;1;"The registration process could not verify my phone number and there are no instructions about how to troubleshoot. Have deleted and reinstalled the app and restarted my phone but with no success.

Turned wi-fi off and worked immediately- should be in the instructions!!!"
au;5;"After trying and failing a million times with no luck to register, turning off my wifi meant I could verify my mobile number without issue.
A glitch for sure, but happy to have found a way to get past it. Fingers crossed it’s something the app developers are working in because not everyone has the time or energy to wade through reviews to find the fix tip."
au;1;"Tried many times. Deleted and reloaded.
Waited until this morning.
All attempts failed"
au;1;"I can’t get it to verify my phone number, regardless of which format I use.  I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times 
🤷🏻‍♂️"
au;1;Have tried several times over past 2 days at various times night and day to complete registration without success. It will not accept phone number even though putting in number without the 0 even tried with zero all failed.
au;1;Tells me my mob. no. Is wrong, 1000’s have this problem so it’s useless
au;1;Will not let me register keep getting phone number error. Sorry I cannot help fight covid
au;1;I’ve been trying multiple times to verify a mobile number. It’s ridiculous! There would likely be 10M people using the app if the mobile verification process actually worked!
au;1;After downloading we cannot log on to either phone. Have updated the phones, used the phone number without the zero, turned the phones on and off, deleted the app and reinstalled but still can’t get past the phone page. What am I doing wrong??????
au;1;The application just hangs and won’t verify my phone number, I tried multiple times.
au;1;I’ve tried numerous times now and the app is unable to verify my mobile number. I am not the only person having this problem.
au;5;If you’re worried about being tracked start by deleting Facebook, Amazon and google apps. This uses Bluetooth which carries no location data.
au;5;Your mind should be at ease because you share info when you decide with a button with just the Aussie government health dept.  Compared to ‘free game or social apps’ that constantly sync data in the background and don’t clearly tell you what they are collecting about you and only ever generally tell you who they shared with. The infamous ‘third parties’ phrase.
au;5;Pull your fkn head in Australia and download the app. If your an anti Vaxer, this is not a needle so you can also download it.
au;1;Trying to set it up but unable to get past ‘get pin’ screen. Several restarts and reinstall made no difference
au;1;"Just letting you know we have tried multiple times waiting for a code but it does not seem to work.  This also happened to my wife.  I guess is the amount of people trying to do the same thing.
After trying all last night and this morning I still do not get a phone code.  Cannot activate the app."
au;1;Sends me an error message when I enter my mobile phone number (in both normal and international format). Have tried deleting app and reloading but still no luck.
au;1;"After several attempts I’ve decided to give up and write a review in the hope someone will read this and then fix the app. 
When I add my mobile number in (yes without the zero), nothing happens, I’ve deleted and downloaded the app 4 times over the past 2 days.
Please fix right away."
au;1;Disappointing! Have tried to do the right thing and download but wheel just spins at the “get pin” stage. Have tried many many times. Have deleted and loaded. And there seems to be no way to get support for this. HELP PLEASE!
au;1;Downloaded but the constant black “CovidSafe” screen flashes prevents anything else happening! Can’t move to next screens. Very rushed job!
au;1;"No PIN number 
Does not work"
au;1;Can’t even sign up because you can’t get past the page asking for your mobile number. Looks like I can’t help 😂
au;5;Happy to do my bit, but that instruction would have been handy rather than spender three hours trying to get the pin
au;2;Really want to do my bit by after repeated attempts to download and install can’t get required pin sent and now app itself flashing. Please fix!!
au;5;Haven’t noticed any problems or battery drain. The whole family’s got it. Anything we can do to on top of COVID, we’re in!
au;1;I downloaded this app as it was announced on the 5 o’clock news. On the first attempt, it said there was an error in verifying the phone number and it never texted a verification code. I tried it again and I got through. BUT my husband has never been able to set it up. Despite many attempts, including deleting the app and redownloading, he has never succeeded in getting it set up. It’s the same problem over and over again ... error in verifying phone number and verification code is never sent. All details are correct. I hear other people are having the same issue. Is it a bug, or an overloaded system, or a phone company vs phone company issue? We’re with Telstra. Sure wish the government could get it sorted out. My husband is a healthcare provider and this app would give us great peace of mind. Help!
au;5;Two of us in our household are unable to get a pin. We have tried reinstalling app and have tried again early this morning. Want to do the right thing but can’t make it work. Can’t verify number is what the message eventually says. One is Samsung one is iPhone.
au;1;Tried several times. Does not recognise my phone number. I’ve left off the leading zero. Looks like this app is not for me.
au;1;I would like to download the app but the registration process will not accept the mobile numbers of both my husband and I.
au;1;I can’t get this app to verify my mobile number. I swear I’m Entering it all correct. Keep getting an error message. I’ve installed / deleted / installed still get the unable to verify error 👎.
au;1;Tried about 30 times to register. Tried without the 0 at the front of the number and with it. Deleted the app, restarted the phone and tried again. No support number. Obviously testing was not a priority. Just wasted hours of my time.
au;1;So try to help. My mobile phone number nor my wife’s could be verified. So, out of the 2+ million Aussies who have downloaded as of this mornings news, how many are actually ’using’ the app?
au;4;If you’re having trouble registering try turning off Bluetooth and wifi. It worked for me - Before I did this, the process was failing at the point where it issues a PIN. Turned off wifi and Bluetooth and registration worked. Turned everything back on afterwards and it seems fine.
au;2;Would not let me get past the phone number stage. Tried 5 times incl. delete and reinstall. Need Application Performance Monitoring so these issues don’t happen.
au;3;My wife and I tried on both our mobiles and we can’t get the confirmation code. We’ve tried with the zero and without the zero in front of the number
au;1;This app won’t install properly. The splash screen keeps popping up during the registration process and then the process stalls when trying to get the PIN. I entered the phone number without the leading 0, no improvement. I’ve reinstalled, restarted and waited all with no effect. For me this app is currently unusable. And yes, I’m using a current phone with an up to date OS...
au;1;Have tried multiple times to get this to work but when it comes to putting in my phone number and I click on “get pin” nothing happens (the little wheel spins to tell me it is thinking about it 😜 but that’s it)
au;1;"Tried for an hour last night, an hour this morning. My mobile number is unable to be verified. Tried deleting the app and downloading again. Tried doing a variation on my name. Tried restarting my phone. OBVIOUSLY did not include the 0. I have the most recent operating system downloaded. Not sure what to do next?

Edited to add: after reading another review turned off my wifi and then it worked. I think this should be made clear as I’m sure I’m not the only one this is happening to."
au;2;Downloaded it after 6 pm, dropped the leading zero but still spent two hours trying to get a PIN to verify my mobile number. Deleted the app and reinstalled but same result. Disappointing.
au;5;Install was easy and the app really explained itself well. Great job trying to keep us all safe.
au;1;"Cannot get the pin at all. Not without a zero in the number or with it.  It says error verifying phone number.
Also there is no support contact, who do I contact to get this done with?"
au;1;I’d like to register but the app won’t accept my mobile number. Pity, I work in a high risk job.
au;1;Tried to install on iPhone 8. Provided mobile number but App hung on sending PIN which we never received. Deleted and reInstalled but still does not work 🦠
au;1;Have tried three or four times, uninstalled and reinstalled. Still doesn’t work. Will try again if they update the app.
au;1;No matter how many times I try, can’t verify my phone number and can’t get the app to work. There doesn’t seem to be any error reporting and support for it.
au;1;Will not accept my mobile number. Have tried on 2 different numbers across 2 days and different times of the day. Fix it.
au;2;Turn your wifi off when registering so it is running off mobile data, worked for everyone in my household who was having the same issue
au;1;My app is Freezing on the mobile number section and won’t give pin - and yes I don’t have zero as it is an international number entry
au;5;"The source code has been thoroughly looked over. Nothing to freak out about.

Even if it constantly tracked your location, you’re all too boring to be constantly surveyed. Stop thinking you’re interesting enough for the government to “spy” on you whatever that entails."
au;1;Error message when I put in my phone number for a pin so I can’t register. I am definitely using my phone number.
au;5;"I have no faith in this current version of the conservative Australian government, from bungled cruise ship entries, to pork barreling sports rorts to dog whistling and politicising of asylum seekers. These are not trustworthy people.
HOWEVER at this time I see no option other than to be as responsible as possible around community health. 

Extraordinary times dictate extraordinary measures, so I have installed the COVIDSafe app a run it whenever I leave my own home. In time I will delete the app and with luck the data won’t have been needed. 

Now is not the time to be sceptical, now is the time to think of the broader community and to act on behalf of public wellbeing.

Downloaded and use this app, the health of all of us may depend upon it."
au;3;"I have tried entering my details and phone number multiple times. Always cones up with an error. 
MyGov uses this number. All my banks use this number. 

But this so called simple app is failing yo do so."
au;2;I dint know why I can’t get pin they ask for it just keeps spinning and eventually sometimes comes up as error we can verify your number and I have tried both with and without the first 0 being put in. I even turned my mobile off and in again still didn’t help I think I noticed one other person having this problem on here are there any others? I really believe in the app but it’s not allowing me access 😪
au;5;What happens if I change my phone number after it’s installed and activated on my old number.
au;1;"Media promised me that it’s for our own good! They said “the app won’t track you *it simply digitises where you’ve been and who you’ve been in contact with* ” 
See it’s totally different! They just want to know where you go and who you talk to. That’s all. Nothing to see here! Nothing fishy about that at all
Guess who got the contract to “store the data”? It’s owned by the “wealthiest man on earth” and the company starts with A and end with mazon."
au;1;"Tried several times to upload name & phone number using the zero and without the zero even deleted the application as well.

Still couldn’t get it to work.

I am definitely entering the correct phone number.

Total waste of time."
au;1;Won’t send me the code
au;2;I am a fairly savvy iPhone user and app installer using an iPhone SE, and it took me many attempts to get it activated. Firstly it refused to accept my 9 digit mobile number (leading zero removed) then, after finally accepting it, it would not send me an SMS message the first time, then it would not accept my pin when entered in a timely way, then it refused to resend me a new pin. I restarted my phone a few times along to way, which sometimes helped to get a little further. Eventually I TURNED OFF MY MOBILE’S WI-FI to force it to use 4G, then I re-did the activation steps and it all worked perfectly and very quickly. My gut feel is this app may be happier authenticating and activating when using the phone’s 4G connection (not Wi-Fi).
au;5;"I kept getting “Error verifying phone number”.
Then I turned off wi-fi and tried again and immediately got my six-digit PIN and it all worked.
Then I turned my wi-fi back on and it’s all working well.
Hopefully this solves the issue for some other people...."
au;1;"Downloaded the app
Tried to register - says there is an error with the phone number; phone number is fine so must be some error somewhere...?"
au;5;Easy to download, and there is no risk of privacy. Please install it on your phone with peace of mind and support Australia simply!!
au;3;I was unable to sign up for this app due to the fact that it says “error” when attempting to text a pin to my phone. However, when I turned my wifi off, and on again, it worked!
au;5;"Easy to use and I don’t worry about security. I use several games and apps like Facebook and Google Maps, Metromate etc which track my movements throughout the day so I’m not worried about a harmless Bluetooth handshake. 

My rights are protected by law so I used this app to protect myself, healthcare workers and people I work with. It’s not a bit deal. Easy to use, too, I just have to remember to leave it running in the background."
au;1;Will not accept my mobile number so I can’t use the app without the verify pin typical
au;5;I’ve always been very wary of government taking too much power but I feel the current admin has been honest about what this apps capabilities are and I am confident it is no more infringing on my rights then any other day to day app. It’s voluntary and I can turn it off when I choose. Happy to see so many other people downloading it too
au;1;Won’t verify my number and yes I have left the zero off the front.
au;5;Over past 24 hours, no noted issues with the battery levels, if this app saves your life, worth while downloading it
au;3;"Kept failing when trying to verify my mobile number after more than 10 attempts. Turned off Wifi on my phone so it uses my mobile telco directly and worked straight away. I think it fails when trying to submit my number via wifi.

Given the short timeframes to create the app, some testing/communication has been overlooked. Let’s hope what we are being told about the app privacy etc is the case and not a let’s hope it works this way and we’ll get the people to QA the app."
au;3;"Had trouble getting app to verify my phone number, so I checked some of reviews and found the fix.

Turn off wifi and try using without wifi
This worked immediately for me.
Hoping they fix the code glitch soon"
au;1;Doesn’t work I’ve tried on 2 phones
au;1;Have entered mobile number multiple times without the 0 and is not recognising .
au;1;I tried to use app but it just gets stuck trying to send a PIN to my phone. Tried different combos and deleted app and tried reinstalling and same problem. Waste of time.
au;4;I kept getting an error that my information couldn’t be verified.  I tried about 10 times. Then I turned my wi-fi off and it registered straight away.
au;5;Doing my bit to help all of us.
au;5;Everyone should download and install immediately!
au;1;Can not verify mobile number. I tried to restart my mobile/ re-install this app/ different mobile number/different name. Nothing working
au;3;"I don’t know why.

I just know it works.

Over to you devs. Put a notice on the front page."
au;1;"Doesn’t work. Can’t get the PIN as it doesn’t recognise the phone number I’ve had for the last 9 years; or is it my name, or my post code?"
au;1;Hangs when you enter a phone number. It says it will send me a PIN and then just displays a waiting animation that doesn’t end.
au;1;It’s a wonderful initiative. I want to take part. But it repeatedly fails on verifying my valid phone number.
au;5;"As an Australian Permanent Resident but UK national I am extremely fortunate to be in this beautiful country during such a globally challenging time for all peoples. This app is testament to the Australian government exercising its primary duty, to protect its people.

The more of us that download the quicker we can all get back normal, and back to work."
au;1;Can’t register it because my perfectly fine mobile number is invalid...
au;1;I can’t get the six digit pin and have tried 10 times or more, I read up on all the info about the correct phone number format but still no joy! I’ve tried turning the Bluetooth off and on and no luck, I’ve deleted the app and tried again and you guessed it, no luck. I’m taking offence at being told there is an “Error verifying phone number and please to check my details and try again”.........really!
au;1;"Trying to signup but the app is failing to verify my mobile number. Have tried multiple times.

I turned wifi off and then it worked using mobile data."
au;5;Easy to install and sign up on iPhone. Does not seem to drain battery. I’d personally like to know if I’d been in contact with a positive case so I can protect my family and my workmates. Significant effort has been put into maximising privacy, the government know they will be strung up if there is a breach. I imagine 99% of the apps on your phone have worse privacy vulnerability than this. Do your part and protect everyone around you! Australia is winning this fight and you can help!
au;5;Games are the best part.
au;1;Entered details and mobile number could not verify!
au;1;I cannot progress past the phone number page (like many other reviews), as it won’t send me a pin. I have deleted the app until this technical glitch is fixed. It’s a great idea for tracing, so hopefully this is fixed soon.
au;4;When I put my phone number in I still remove the zero from the front but it doesn’t do anything but show a loading circle and stays like that and It won’t send a pin code so if you can update it then I’ll be able to use it.
au;5;The easiest of apps to sign up to and the best way we can help each other!!
au;1;I am keen to download the app but I can't as I'm also getting a pin error. Have tried 3 different times of day. Am leaving a review as I don't know where else or who else to report this to.
au;1;I cannot register as I cannot get the PIN number when I enter my mobile number. The app does not work.
au;1;Does not accept my phone number
au;1;"I downloaded, then started setting it up. After entering my phone number, it just was just spinning for ages to send me a six digit PIN. I tried multiple times in the end I just gave up. 

Will try again tomorrow. It would be nice if this thing works the first time."
au;4;If you see this error check to make sure you’re not on a wifi connection. You need to be on a mobile data connection to complete the verification process. Just thought I’d share what I worked out as a fix after seeing the same error as many others.
au;1;Tried to register wouldn’t recognise my number. Tried using all 10 digits and twice leaving first 0 off. No difference. So deleted app
au;4;"I had dramas getting it to register my mobile number. I tried several times but in the end I turned off wifi on my phone & it worked straight away.

Doing my bit to help Australia’s economy & get us out of self isolation sooner."
au;1;After downloading the app have been trying all nite to have it accept mobile number. What a dudd. I’m out of here !
au;1;Error when I enter phone number with a zero or without it, I want to join but it won’t let me , how many others are like me... hope the bug can be fixed. Using an iPhone 7 thanks David
au;1;I have been trying to install since yesterday. As I enter my mobile number(I did not add zero at the beginning) it keeps on “getting pin” for forever. Not sure what happened. Tired restarting phone, uninstalling and installing again. Nothing is working. And my phone is iPhone X.
au;1;"I have been trying for four hours to log in and when I get to entering my mobile it comes up with error recognising phone number. I have tried turning phone off, tried entering mobile number without the zero and still nothing. If this type of error occurs at the beginning then how can we trust the app to give true readings. 
Very frustrated."
au;1;I have tried several times and can’t get a pin. Useless app
au;5;Once you do the above app works.
au;5;"Update: worked once I turned off wifi. 
 
”Same problem as others, the app will not recognise my phone number with or without the 0.” One star"
au;3;Keying in my number correctly (tried with and without an 0 at the front) and getting nothing but a loading wheel...
au;1;When asked to put my phone number in I get the response “Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again” I have tried several times with no success. How am I supposed to use?
au;5;It seems to me that if you have an Amazon account they would have your real name and phone no. If you have Alexa Amazon can hear your conversations. If you have Google it is pinging your location. Even stores ask for your location when you go to their website. So how in gracious is this an invasion of privacy? Or a worry on security! Beats me. Come on Aussies do your bit and download this app
au;1;App would not let me verify my mobile.  I left off the 0 and put it on but still not able to verify.
au;1;I want to use this app to help reduce social distancing restrictions yet the app reckons it can’t verify my number!!!!
au;1;Got stuck in the enter your number part. Tried putting zero and no zero, but still can’t access the next part.
au;5;"Yes doing my bit to get Australia moving again until someone develops a vaccine for COVID-19
No problems installing the app and the battery life on my phone is still good."
au;1;My phone number does not work!!! Why !!
au;5;"Had trouble getting past entering my phone number and getting pin. Kept getting a message to say they couldn’t verify phone number! Yes, I did delete the 0 from the beginning of the number. 😊
If you find you have problems too.... the trick is to turn off your wifi. It works using the mobile data!!"
au;5;Let us do our bit to help the government to fight this bug. Well done so far . Let’s finish this together. (Pauline Hanson & Barnaby Joyce needs  technical assistance !)
au;1;Doesn’t send sms to verify pin.
au;1;5 hours trying to get it to accept my phone number. I give up. Can’t understand how so many have had no problem. Tried with zero in and zero out nothing works.
au;1;Entered my information, but the app tells me there’s an error in my phone number. Assuming the provided “+61” is the leading Zero, I entered the rest of my mobile number. No luck. Can’t finish the registration.
au;1;I want to install this app for all that it supports. However the app won’t accept my phone number and says I need to check my details ... I’ve entered both with the 0 and without, multiple times ... i have now also deleted the app and retried multiple times. I hope they are basing their registration count on successfully registered numbers and not app downloads!! Imagine how many registrations there would be if this was smooth sailing!
au;1;I have an iPhone X, I took of the 0, updated my phone, changed my name and I could not get it to work. I even waited until late night. Still no luck.
au;1;"Enter phone number. Can’t recognise phone number.
Check phone number. Enter phone number.
Can’t recognise phone number...."
au;1;It seems they don’t want me to read the terms of use. Every 2 seconds it goes black and it tries to make me accept the terms.
au;1;Won’t allow me to verify mobile number
au;1;I know that a lot people have successfully gotten this app to register, however, both my wife and I do not receive any sms pin. She is using Telstra and I am on Vodafone. We do not use the zero in our mobile numbers. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted the iPhones, etc. no luck. I also cannot seem to find a support number or email.
au;1;I’ve tried 5 times to get this thing to send me a pin so giving up and deleting - useless - Australian Gov can never do effective tech - it always fails at the first step - the entry point!
au;1;No pun received
au;5;Easy to sign up and easy to use. Minimal personal info required too!
au;1;I have tried multiple times, the error message  ‘Error verifying phone number, please check your details and try again’ continues to come up when I press get PIN. I have tried uninstall and reinstall, same issue, now husbands is doing same thing.
au;1;I have download the app on my iPhone, but have spent several hours trying to get it to accept my phone number and get the six digit verification code sent to me to complete the registration process. I am 100% sure I’m entering my mobile number correctly but it just keeps failing. I have been unable to locate a help desk type number to get support. So from my perspective it’s just not working and hasn’t been thought through correctly
au;2;Happy to register and have tried several rimes but doesn’t recognise my phone number (tried with and without the zero). App seems to have some problems....
au;5;Use the app and help clear the country of this damn virus. You would not want your mates to get this virus and using this app will help stop the spread.
au;3;I downloaded this app but soon deleted it when I  read online that for it to actually work you need to have it open all the time on your iPhone and you need to have your iPhone unlocked and have the app always on and it apparently chews up battery life on an iPhone leaving it open. It is easy to register to get in the app and it gives you a PIN number over text message to verify in the app for it to load your details you submitted. I read it will notify you when the pandemic is over to delete the app on notifications or maybe text message.
au;4;I support the app as I want to know if I’m exposed to covid-19 and I’d like others to know if I exposed them so we can stop its spread. It wouldn’t verify my phone number though and gets stuck on the get pin screen.
au;5;To all those out there who are suspicious about whether you can trust the government about this kind of thing, please understand that the entire source code has been made public. We can understand exactly how the information works, and I'd encourage you to google and do some reading if you're worried and on the fence. This is going to be a really powerful tool to help us fight this pandemic, and it's important as many of us have this app as possible.
au;1;Have been trying all day to get this app to work. When I tap next to verify my phone number (yes, I left off the zero) I get the wheel of death - I don’t even get to the error message others are getting - just the white-line wheel that spins and spins and spins. I was so keen to get this app to help get C19 under control but can’t even get past the verification stage.....🤷🏻‍♀️
au;1;I can’t get past the mobile verification page - just freezes on trying to send me a pin. I’m in an up to date iPhone 11. Hope this isn’t happening to millions of others. That would be awkward.
au;1;It keeps telling my mobile number is wrong. I’ve tried with and without the 0 at the start. Pretty pointless app if it refused to acknowledge that I do infact know my own phone number, and I’m typing it correctly ☹️
au;5;I read the privacy information and quite frankly sounds more secure than most of the apps I have on my phone. Quite frankly if ASIO, CIA, NAC. or any other spook outfit want to know how many tines I go to woolies or Coles in a week they really need to get a life!!
au;1;Cant activate - my mobile number isnt valid?
au;1;Won’t get further than putting my mobile number in then comes up with an error. I have entered my number beginning with 0 and have also entered it without the 0 due to the +61 already being there. Doesn’t really surprise me though.
au;5;This app is truly great.
au;1;I get to the part where I put in my phone number and it comes up with an error after about 4 minutes saying it cannot verify my phone number? I’ve tried the number without the 0 with the +61 and it still won’t work after trying 3 different ways 3 times I gave up! Frustrating!
au;1;I’ve tried numerous times to register.  However, at the point of providing my phone number the app fails. I’m aware that you drop the zero when adding the phone number. Big fail from me.
au;5;Thankyou daddy for making us safer
au;5;Thank you Australia for providing this app and allowing me to play a part in combatting this terrible disease
au;1;Have tried to register twice but it keeps crashing 😡
au;1;App will not send me a Pin. Been trying off and on for over 5 hours.
au;2;Seems good , So, tried to download it but couldn’t verified my details. I don’t know. I put all the details correctly still giving error while sending 6 digit pin..
au;1;tried to install multiple times but wont recognise my phone number, no help contact to resolve.
au;5;"I think this app is a great Inititive. For the fearful...If it proves to take away your privacy delete it. Ironically this APP will give back some freedoms. By the way; I have an IT company. If you own a device that can download this app than you can already be tracked, but there is not a big computer in the sky trying to figure out your every move, they only want to sell you something....read google androids and apples terms and conditions. You have already given up those rights before you downloaded this APP.  But this APP will save lives! Get behind it. Support each other."
au;1;Won’t send me six digit code to register
au;5;Nothing to lose, only things to gain by using this. I develop this stuff for a living so I can tell you it's safe. The government isn't going to know more about you than they already do.
au;1;Error verifying phone number. With and without leading 0. WiFi on and off. Deleted and reinstalled app. Turned phone on and off. iPhone 11.
au;3;"The app works and installed easy.
Computer nerds around Australia are wanting to get the source code for this app so they can dissect it and see exactly what it does and how it works.   If the Govt really have nothing to hide, why are they not prepared to release the source code.  After all, it’s just an app that supposedly doesn’t impinge on people’s privacy and civil liberties.   Somehow I think there is more to it that what they say."
au;3;"Had trouble trying to sign up. Couldn’t get past inputting my mobile number. No matter how I tried entering it ( with or without the 0), it wouldn’t work! 
Even tried rebooting my phone and it still wouldn’t work. 

Decided to try doing I again without being connected to my home wifi and instantly got the verification text. 

Maybe make the set up wifi compatible so people don’t get annoyed."
au;2;I have downloaded this app and then tried and it has said many times there has been an error then I deleted and I repeated those steps and it still occurred I was happy to get the app and play my part to stop the spread but I am now sad that I cannot do that
au;5;Would be better if you have an Apple Watch version
au;4;I just downloaded this app and when asked for the code I flicked between the Covidsafe app to my messages and then back to the Covidsafw app. When I returned a black screen with covidsafe text appeared which didn't me to see the code I was trying to enter. Would be good to get these issues sorted and feedback helps which is why I am writing this review.
au;3;The app is stuck and keeps trying to send pin, not working. Deleted app and reloaded it and still not working for me.
au;4;If you are having issues verifying your phone number, switch off you wifi and register with mobile data. It should work straight away then.
au;1;I have left the first 0 off and it will not load.  Coming up with error.  What do u suggest ?
au;1;"I keep getting this same error message after pressing the “get PIN” button.
I’ve tried having no leading zero, then tried with the zero. Also tried deleting and reinstalling the app."
au;5;This is a great way to use your blue tooth signal to tag other users for 21 days, in the event there is an infection everyone can be notified and get a test. Together as a country Australia can beat this
au;1;Won’t register phone number - gets error.
au;1;I didn’t receive an Verification Message to access which is very disappointing I want to see an update of the app to fix this glitch as soon as possible
au;2;"Was ready to do my civic responsibilities but the app in no way would accept my phone number even after several restarts 
Not happy jan"
au;1;"I want to get on board and do my bit, but for some reason my completely fine phone number won’t be verified; very frustrating"
au;1;I have down loaded deleted down loaded several times it won’t accept my phone number and yes I removed the 0 ☹️
au;1;"Needs access to functions that I don’t use. Pointless for me as the app would never work.

Better option, have an app that tells people that face masks won’t stop you getting COVID and if you’re wearing a face mask, then obviously you should’ve be out and about as you’re a risk to everyone else because you have COVID.

Of better still, an app that tells you which local supermarkets have the types/brands of pasta, rice, flour, hand soap, toilet paper and tissues in stock do you can actually get what you need."
au;1;More app issues related to Amazon:Cloud scalability
au;1;Couldn’t verify phone number to get PIN number so I’m deleting it
au;5;After getting frustrated being told phone number is invalid......I turned off WIFI and hey presto....everything worked:)
au;3;It won’t let me put my mobile in. Says error verifying phone number.
au;2;I too have been getting an error message saying my mobile number is not valid. Have been trying for two hours to complete the registration  and still unsuccessful.
au;1;Cannot get past get pin. Times out. Have tried with and without leading 0 on mobile number
au;4;"I have not been able to verify my phone number through this app yet to get it working. I’ve deleted & re-installed, dropped the 0, tried many times. Anyone have any ideas?? 

I’ve left 4 stars as I don’t want to de-value the app, but it is a bit frustrating as I don’t know who to contact about this. Thanks"
au;1;Downloaded but it won’t accept my phone number.
au;1;The app doesn’t recognise my mobile number at all and doesn’t give me a pin to verify and get started
au;5;Grateful for the ease to download the app.
au;1;"Can’t get past the mobile number entry. 

Just comes up with an error and can’t verify. 

Won’t generate pin."
au;1;Downloaded but won’t Celt my phone number please fix
au;1;This app keeps saying there is an error with my mobile phone number, but my number is correct. Tried deleting and reinstalling the app on numerous occasions.
au;1;I have been trying to sign up. I get to the phone number part and can’t get past it. Keeps saying error finding phone number. Blue tooth is on. I’ve deleted and re downloaded the app and still same problem. Same as on my husbands phone. We have an IPhone
au;5;I gave this a one star after being unable to get past the “error verifying phone number” message, and I was unable to get a pin after several attempts. Then I switched off my WiFi and just used 4G and it worked straight away! Maybe they need to include that in the instructions.
au;1;5 attempts to install, takes forever at “sending pin”, then finally after 10 mins informs that it can’t verify my number
au;5;Help save lives ! It’s in our hands Australia let’s do this.
au;5;"I’m usually a bit sceptical about using certain government apps. It says on the news it’s encrypted, protects your details and you don’t have to give your real name. Only
People who can contact you is the health professionals and NOT even the police can access it. If you want to get this epidemic done and over with, get the app. It can also protect you too."
au;2;Regardless if I tried 04xxxxxxxx or 4xxxxxxxx.. tried a couple of times all failed so can’t finish the registry.
au;1;Lots of people including myself had issues verifying their mobile number. If you turn wifi off and try again, it worked and sent a pin straight away.
au;1;"It doesn’t recognise my phone number.
I tried many times."
au;1;Cannot get PIN. No difference even if leading zero is left off.  What were the developers thinking? Could be more user friendly. Typical IT development without real world thinking.
au;5;"Downloaded and deleted, restarted phone and it still doesn’t recognize my phone number
Turn your wifi off and you will get your code!
Thanks to “bigglesworth” supplying the info!"
au;1;It’s phone valid process is not functional. Useless
au;5;Do the right thing. Download the app. Let’s get on with our lives sooner.
au;1;Tried to setup many times and keep getting invalid phone number - Ive has this number for over 25 years ... I can’t hey past point so can’t install the app... will Jager to wait into it gets fixed...
au;1;"An an Australian Citizen, that is an expat returning during this COVIT-19 period on advice from the Australian government. 

I use an international number on roaming and can’t use this app as it only accepts Australian mobile numbers. 

It’s a shame."
au;2;TrIed to see this up on iPhone SE, tried a few times reboot delete reinstall. Running IOS 13.3.1  I can’t get verification code to register the app..
au;1;Tried with and without 0 after the +61. I run duel SIM (hardware sim and esim). Might have something to do with it????? Deleted app. I did try.
au;1;Trying to download this app as I want to help but it keeps saying error verifying phone number! Have tried numerous times, both with and without the zero at the front. Really frustrating, gonna have to just uninstall it and give up.
au;1;I want to sign up but need the PIN which I’ve tried to get multiple times but nothing happens...
au;3;Constant Bluetooth search by the app for nearby devices severely interferes with performance of other Bluetooth technologies in vicinity, eg computer peripherals. Have to turn Phone (and therefore covidsafes) Bluetooth to be able to continue to work. This then requires me to actually remember to turn it on again when leaving the house. Not a great user experience
au;5;Had error verifying phone number and then started to glitch with black screen with Covid safe logo. I just removed numbers from my name and had no issues at all logging in.
au;5;Get the app!!!
au;5;great idea everyone download thanks
au;3;At enter your mobile number, it just buffers and doesn’t send me the pin to continue.
au;4;"Tried many times to get a code. With and without a zero etc and several restarts of the app. 

Decided to turn off wifi, not sure why but text came straight after."
au;1;Disappointing to find the same issue that may other users have experienced with the mobile number failing verification.  Appears someone wrote that bit of code on Friday afternoon... .    However, try turning off wifi and using the cellular network and it seems to fix the issue.  Stay safe people.
au;1;Been trying to do my part, but unfortunately the app doesn’t work. Unable to verify my phone number, which makes no sense.
au;5;If you are having trouble getting the app to verify your phone, make sure you are not using wifi calling. Wouldn’t verify for me until I turned wifi off.
au;5;Easy to set up, the app only takes the information you give it which is name, phone number, postcode, and age range.  Download it so I can go to the pub!
au;1;I wanna do my bit to help, but I can’t get your app to send me a pin. I enter my details, then my phone number, click next and it just wigs out. The old spinning wheel of death. Better luck next time ScoMo.
au;4;App seems good but it is a bit of a battery hog!
au;3;Xx
au;1;Put on my details. Doesn’t recognise my phone number!
au;1;Terrible time trying to register the app on my phone. The screen keeps flicking back to a black screen that says covid safe app. I wasn’t able to read through the information.
au;4;"Simply turn off WIFI on your phone, so it’s just 4G mobile data on. Finally it worked.

Phone now resumed using WIFI as well as 4G. All good,"
au;1;"Gets to “we’ll send you a seven digit verification and fails with an error check details and try again”
All details correct! 🤭🤔"
au;5;"Just installed this. If you are in Australia, please install it too. 

For anyone with concerns about privacy, from a technical perspective, this saves Far Less data than Facebook or Google Maps. It also only saves nearby phones if you have been together for 15 mins. And without GPS it doesn’t provide hotspot data. It also does not continuously send data, instead doing a download of positive cases. 

Overall, it’s extremely limited compared to what’s being hyped. Still, some mechanism to be alerted to being at risk is better than nothing. Please install."
au;5;Doing my bit to ensure my and community’s wellbeing.
au;3;"When I try to enter my number it comes up with an error, “Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again.”

I’ve triple checked my number and have tried about 5 times including closing app and reopening."
au;5;"If you having the issue that it can not verify your mobile number error. 
Make sure that you have wifi off! In other words be on 4G / mobile data. 

Hope that helps and stay safe"
au;1;When I put my mobile number in the app keeps saying the number doesn’t match. I’ve deleted and reinstalled but same thing happens. A friend of mine in another state is having the same issue.  I have tried it dropping the zero and it still says error
au;5;I installed on both mine and my mums phone. No issues installing on my phone, and once we turned off wifi on mums phone she was able to verify her number and install it with no issues.
au;1;My phone is compatible but it’s not working. Every time I put my mobile number in it comes up with an error. Error verifying mobile number. It is not an overseas phone either.
au;1;App just crashes on register unable to use
au;1;I’ve tried my phone number with zero and without as the first digit, the app will not let me verify my phone number. So I can’t use it because I can’t complete the registration process.
au;1;Won’t accept my number. Tried with and without leading zeroes.  Poor effort. Programming 101:  putting out a message like ‘error verifying your phone number’ is sloppy, lazy programming.  A well written app would tell you why - number is in the wrong format should be XXXXX, server is too busy, etc.
au;1;Try to do the right thing but the app just spins and spins when I ever my phone number.  Have tried with and without the 0 and have also deleted and re-installed with the same problem.  Ridiculous!!
au;1;I have tried numerous times to get the app working but it keeps coming up with an error message and can’t verify my mobile number. I use an iPhone.
au;5;Do your bit
au;5;I had the above error but found if I turned my wifi off and then put my number in it worked! Then went back in and turned wifi back on again!
au;1;Keeps saying my phone number is invalid and won’t let me continue
au;5;Anyone suggesting this is an invasion of their privacy should consider the benefits. Funny how we’ve got nowhere near as many objections to social media tracking our every move...
au;5;Participating with that app is for me a no brainer. If I can protect others, my friends, family and mates, then I’m IN!!! People can get tested earlier and the spread gets stopped earlier. That’s how Germany does it and they have a very low death rate!
au;5;This app is amazing. I would strongly recommend all Australians download it. Set up is easy and does not eat into battery. Anyone of any age can download and use it. Younger children will need a parent's consent.
au;2;I tried to put this app on my husband’s phone but it didn’t recognise his phone number.
au;1;Stuck at Get Pin page.Stress Testing was not done well it seems.
au;2;I have no problem with the tracing side of things. After signing in and verifying, the app indicating it was working. Next morning, I got a notification that took me back to the app to enter all details again, which I skipped and deleted the app. Can we get an update?
au;1;I tried 4 times to register and have now deleted the app and given up.
au;1;Like many others, it won’t accept my mobile number. I am not putting the 0 at the front.
au;1;Trying to add my mobile number but the get pin wheel just keeps spinning. My friend tried and got invalid phone number error - for a correct number?!
au;5;Do it now. Delete it next year.  Let’s get Covid out of our population so we can go back to normal.  Yes it is invasive. But it is necessary for now.
au;1;"If you’re using Bluetooth Headphones then COVIDSafe probably won’t work effectively. 

In fact there are hundreds of possible and like scenarios that defeat COVIDSafe due to multiple design flaws. 

But hey, it’s only version 1, build 10."
au;5;Good for contact tracing!
au;2;Sign in process is trash its not letting me sign up everything works until i try to put in my phone number and it says error please check your details when i’ve checked them and there correct but it still says error
au;1;I’m happy to use the app to help protect the community. However the app won’t accept my mobile number so is currently on my phone but useless
au;2;Very frustrating to have an issue entering my phone number. I did not add the zero at the beginning (just went straight to 4......) and still had an issue. I updated my phone, removed and reinstalled the app and still had the issue. Really annoying.
au;3;The app looks promising and could prove to be very effective in controlling the spread of virus using technology. As a responsible Australian,  I also wanted to contribute to the community  in helping contact tracing, however i gave up after trying for the whole day to register my mobile number. Every time It throws error: error verifying mobile number.
au;4;"If you are getting an error message not verifying your phone no, switch off WiFi and try it again.

Very important initiative!"
au;1;After entering my phone number, I received an error message saying “unable to verify phone number. Check details and try again.” Unable to find any information on how to troubleshoot this. Thus, I can’t use the app even though I wanted to. Disappointing
au;1;Will not accept Australian mobile phone number - either dropping the leading ‘0’ or including it...  totally useless as a result.
au;1;"I downloaded the app on my i phone.
I entered all the personal details correctly and it shows my details are incorrect!!!
I tried many times show the same error."
au;1;"I’ve downloaded the app and when I put my phone number in it returns a error -

“Error verifying phone number”

Annoying...."
au;5;Be safe and be safe for others
au;1;How do I activate app when it wouldn’t send me a PIN to activate. All the information provided is correct but it still says can’t verify mobile number?!?!
au;5;Works well.
au;5;So we can get to the pub quicker
au;1;"I was sent the code but the app said it was wrong.
I have been unable to get past the point where it says to download information. 
I tried several times but still can’t download it. Frustrating"
au;1;Tried to but it keeps rejecting my phone numbers. I also tried deleting the app and reinstalling, plus putting the zero in front of the number.
au;3;"Some basic rules needed. 
1) you need a name, age and postcode. 
2) need a mobile number to register. 
Big hint it will only send a confirmation code if you have mobile data turned on. It will not send the code if mobile data is turned off. 
3) final step is to confirm Bluetooth is turned on
4) you have successfully installed and registered of sorts the covidsafe app. 

Thank you."
au;1;Both my wife and I downloaded this app and both got a message saying that it failed when verifying the phone number. We tried both with and without the leading zero and got the same message each time. Great start...
au;1;So you cannot download the App if you do not use Australian App Store. So for all the internationals here and those who are locked into say the US App Store you cannot download. That needs fixing right away. Particularly as people one day start to travel again.
au;2;Downloaded the app trying to do my part in the fight against Covid 19 but it won’t accept my ph number and yes I dropped the zero, also tried with the zero 🙄hope this get fixed ASAP
au;1;Like a lot of others the app can’t verify my phone number in the registration process. I’ve tried with and without the leading zero but it makes no difference.
au;3;Have loaded app on both my phone and my husband’s. Phone number accepted on my phone but not my husband’s with the error message that his number is unable to be verified. 0 or no 0 at the beginning of the number does not make a difference.
au;1;Can’t sign up - won’t accept my phone number.
au;5;Super quick and easy setup. No dramas at all.
au;1;Have now tried to enter my mobile number at least 20 times both with the 0 at the front and without and it keeps giving an error message! I would hope that this gets fixed quickly because I’m a willing participant and I’m getting frustrated, if anyone was a reluctant participant and this error happened continuously I think they would lose a lot of people and those people would just say oh well I tried and it didn’t work! Sort it out!
au;1;I’ve entered my phone number correctly with and without leading zero and keeps returning same error. Bug to be squashed.
au;1;"It won’t verify my number or details so I can’t go past putting my telephone number in. 
What else can I do as I’m trying to help the stop of COVID:19. Disappointing after all the hype about it."
au;2;"I think due to the immense number of people attempting to get onboard... the app is not coping with the pressure… 
Have been trying since released to have my number registered and have waited at different times up to an hour waiting on the pin to be sent to me... have given up now"
au;1;I’ll change the rating once I can activate, just wanted to lodge the bug
au;1;I am an AU citizen. Who normally lives overseas. Came here and got stuck (blessing now) when Corona broke out across the world. I want to do my part as I am living with family and 2 are essential workers. But my UK phone plan is better value than an Aussie one, so I’m not interested in getting a Aussie one (and having to pay twice for phone sims) - i don’t understand why it’s necessary to have a AU number only. There will be so many people in Australia for any number of reasons who don’t have an AU number who will still want to download this and do the right thing. So please, Australian Government please open this up to any phone number.
au;5;A great move in public health.  I really want everyone to download to help each other and Australia manage Covid19 x
au;1;After so much hype about this app it’s disappointing that it won’t accept my phone number. Tried with zeroes and without zeroes, just get an error message!
au;5;"Play your part. Help save lives. 
It’s a necessary app to help us collective take #PublicHealth action to defeat this Pandemic. Download, turn on, help us trace this 🦠... 🙏"
au;1;Tried to register but wouldn’t accept my mobile number and gave error message. Many others using the app do not sure why
au;1;The failure of the app to recognise people’s phone number renders this app useless. I would give it no stars if I were able to!
au;1;And yes, I’ve tried without adding the first 0. I’ve deleted and retried 5 times. Think I’ll give up now.
au;2;Easy to download and simple to use but would like to have it linked to the Apple Watch.  Don’t need to carry a phone most times as my watch can make and receive calls. It would make sense that when the watch is in range of your phone that it refreshes the new data just like your health apps do.
au;3;The app seems straight forward however outside of grocery shopping we only leave our home for exercise - When exercising we often only carry a smart watch.   Are you missing low hanging interactions ( eg: grabbing a takeaway coffee at the end of a ride ) by only having a phone app.
au;5;This application is good! A very nice effort from the Australian Government to help stop the spread of the coronavirus!
au;1;Keeps coming up as an error with my mobile number, have tried putting it in differently, closing the app and trying again ect. But can’t get it to work
au;4;Fine for me, but my mum in her 70s uses an old iPhone 4 hand me down and can’t download it due to software limitations. This has to be a common situation for the older generation by whom this app should ideally be used. Please bring out a version compatible with earlier versions of iOS!
au;3;Will not accept my mobile number after multiple attempts. Not sure if this means the app won’t be doing its thing????
au;1;The app won’t send me a pin, then error pops up saying cannot verify your number.
au;1;This sucked my battery dry within hours (and I wasn’t even out and about). Be good if it only activated when you weren’t at home.
au;1;The app is unable to verify my phone number. Tried several times. Nothing seems to work.
au;1;I have an iPhone 11 and when trying to download I get an error message saying Error verifying phone number. Nothing wrong with my number so.????
au;1;App gets stuck on entering the phone number. Spins a spins.
au;3;For some reason I’ve tried to enter my number and even tried a family member’s phone number i still couldn’t get the pin. Also know someone with the same issue
au;1;Been trying for at least an hour and get verifying error. I give up.
au;1;Both I and my wife have downloaded the app and when we attempt to register it doesn’t recognise our mobile numbers..tried several times but sorry not working..
au;1;Tried 3 times but each time rejected my mobile number. No help anywhere as to what could be wrong.
au;1;Keep getting error message can’t verify number, please check details. I think I know my name and phone number. It’s a work phone
au;1;App won’t accept my mobile number, have tried leaving off the first 0 like others have suggested in the reviews. My wife is also having the same issue! Therefore app is useless as you cannot proceed without a mobile number!
au;1;Keeps saying my mobile number is invalid. Please don't release it if you can't perfect the registration process!
au;2;Can see the benefit but can’t register as my phone number can’t be validated for some reason. Have tried numerous times. Giving up and deleted app now.
au;1;Trying to do my bit but can’t get past verifying phone number. Phone number is correct. Shut down and rebooted but still the same message. No tech support available
au;1;"Cannot get the pin and verification of phone number. Needs to be fixed no point downloading an app if you cannot register.

It is just timing out. Maybe too many people trying to verify at same time.

Really want to get on board but it just is not working."
au;5;Look into the theory. I trust our medical experts. This is NOT political. Its science for a better future.
au;4;To the developers of this app and Aussie government, brilliant initiative!  Let’s keep us safe and keep our privacy safe.  I was a bit of a skeptic initially, but feel assured my privacy is being protected.  This is the best way for us Aussie’s to kick this virus and get back to our normal life - because this lockdown life is ultra boring!
au;2;Put in a valid phone number. App says error with phone number after a long delay. We’re all trying to help but seems to be some issues with this app or the process
au;1;Tried for 20 minutes. The App can’t find my phone number so I can register.
au;1;Meh
au;1;But it’s not sending my mobile a code. Just a spinny wheel of death.
au;1;Unable to get PIN
au;1;"Must be some glitch; can’t get anything"
au;1;It’s good idea for Deaf people and hard of hearing. !  If call by voice will not answer voice caller.
au;1;M Taylor
au;1;I was keen for this app when I return to work, although it is not accepting my phone number. Please fix this. Thankyou
au;1;This is poor— it won’t allow me to put in my Mobil phone number
au;4;Relatively easy to set up, however, had errors verifying my number.. had to turn off wifi and also enter my mobile number without the zero
au;5;"Hey keyboard warriors 
Can you guys just shut up, and go work for government if you can make it better?"
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number
au;4;Does the app have to be opened on the screen all the time for it to work? Or can it just be running in the background?
au;2;This is not letting me register. Is there any limitations for visa holders to subscribe it?
au;1;As per usual dropped the mobiles first number of 0, still can’t get through
au;5;I downloaded the app with no dramas and hope that most Aussies do so too in order to help the the country get back to pre COVID conditions. One suggestion I’d love to see would be extending the app to smart watches. On many occasions I leave my phone at home as I can also use my watch as a phone.
au;3;I have an issue registering. When I enter my mobile number and press “Get PIN” it gets stuck loading.
au;1;Neither my husband or I were able to verify our mobile phone numbers so unable to use the app
au;1;"Failed to verify phone number after multiple attempts - with and without leading 0. 

Not a very encouraging start."
au;5;"Let’s hope people use it; little to loos lots to gain..."
au;5;"Downloaded app.
I would like to know if I have been close to anyone with virus to keep myself and family safe.
Thank you"
au;5;Turned off wifi. Closed all other apps and did a hard reset on the phone. Restarted phone and clicked on the COVIDSafe App. Registration only took a few seconds and it appears to be working fine now. 👍
au;1;When I tried to enter my mobile number... tried every option, with & without 0 in front, it doesn’t accept mobile number.
au;1;Unable to register my mobile to sign up for the app
au;1;keeps hanging when trying to retrieve pin #
au;5;"Want to have the app; but unfortunately I do not do the ow have a mobile number, but I do have an iPhone that I carry around.(self funding issue) without verifying a mobile number I can’t get the app? Maybe add an email option 👍🏽"
au;1;"It does not like my phone number
It takes it and goes off to get a pin number (for who knows why), then takes ages to get back with an error message."
au;3;I saw this app and thought that getting it would be a good idea but when I tried to sign in but I couldn’t it said there was something wrong with my phone number and I know there is nothing wrong with it
au;5;"I was a little bit concerned about the privacy before I heard Sunday’ live by Dr. Murphy. You can use fake name, the infos you need to input are age group and post code. Records would be destroyed after 21 days.
Hopefully we can unstall the app sooner."
au;1;Will not send 2nd PIN number so you can upload ya information
au;1;"Getting the error
“Error verifying phone number”"
au;5;Easy to install, register and confident it only does what it is intended to.
au;1;When I try to register it says my phone number is not valid. But I’m using my correct name and phone number. My wife has the same problem.
au;5;"This app is safer than I originally thought. It’s crowdsourced information and not invading personal information. I already use several crowdsourcing apps. After reading the privacy information I happily installed it. I have literally far more invasive apps installed! MyGov, google, Social networking, banks.
As a nurse .. I would have installed it regardless, as anything to help Australia fight this virus is important. I’d expect all HCW and first responders to have this installed. 
#justdoit #fightcorona"
au;1;How will it ever work if it refuses to accept my mobile number?!!
au;5;"Just follow the simple instructions!
I see there were a few had trouble earlier/ I guess that was ironed out- it’s a 1 minute task."
au;1;"Sceptical, but downloaded and began set up with a false name I was then asked for my phone number so I could be sent a 6 digit code to verify that phone number
I entered my mobile number and hit “Get Pin”.... spinning doughnut for 5 minutes then an error message saying my number coukd not be verified, please check details. All details were correct EXCEPT my real name... wonder why my phone number couldn’t be verified???? Hmmmm app deleted not going to bother"
au;5;All sorted in less than a minute. If this helps deal with outbreaks quickly, and gets restrictions lifted, it’s worth any perceived danger to my civil rights...and if the spooks want to follow me, they are welcome to. It might even cure their insomnia...
au;1;Tried several times and cannot past mobile pin. Not sending me the pin!
au;5;This App is intending to protect you, not steal your private info.
au;3;Couldn’t register my phone number, error message. My info is correct (including the lack of 0) Tried multiple times, then tried the turning off WiFi and it worked.
au;5;Works well and protects us all. I am impressed. Well done.
au;1;I have been trying to download but it keeps telling me it’s having trouble verifying my phone number,don’t know what else I can do.
au;5;Maybe the next update you can use apple watch
au;5;"The more people who download it, the sooner we can get back to normality.  

Most people give way far far more personal details on social media. This app asks for very little info."
au;5;"It’s absolutely the right thing to do. It’s for the common good. We are in a public emergency. We need to take the context into consideration, this app could keep our family and citizens safe. This app could keep the community safer as is safe distancing. 

The risks introduced by the app is balanced to potential benefits it could deliver; which could be ‘saving a life’!

Delete it when the pandemic is over..."
au;1;Unable to access PIN so can’t complete
au;1;No instructions on how to troubleshoot install. Does not accept my mobile number ??? Want to do the right thing but unable under the circumstances
au;1;Spinning wheel of death on “get pin” screen
au;5;"The app could not be easier to set up. Great initiative by the Australian Government to help keep us safe through this pandemic. It’s like an insurance policy, there only if you need it. No privacy concerns. 

Help the community and get it on your phone."
au;1;Will not be using this until the Au Gov implements the upcoming Apple/Google ‘exposure notification’ API. I do not feel comfortable with the centralised data approach they are currently using.
au;4;Zapping energy
au;5;Would like to get the bans and restrictions lifted sooner. Would like to see more Australians downloading the app. My recommendation is that comms from telco to download the app might boost numbers.
au;5;Install the app and use it. It’s the fastest way to get out of this crisis. Happy with the safeguards put in place by the Government to protect data and not use the information against us. Well done ScoMo/Hunty
au;5;Stop being paranoid of the government being able to track you, that should be the least of your worries right now! The faster this is over with, the quicker we can recover from this pandemic
au;5;Very easy to install, only took a minute and all work without issue. Something so simple to help protect my family and I and hopefully get us out of lockdown sooner is a no-brainer!
au;5;Some issues at initial launch but it works fine now. Reassured by people who have decompiled it, particularly that my contact details aren’t being sent to the other people I am in range of.
au;2;"Happy to help elderly family with the installation of this important app. 

My feedback is that the verification number expires too quickly and they were unable to get it entered within the time limit.  Can the expiry be extended or can a different verification be used so that all Australians who want to do their bit, are able to participate.

Otherwise well done!"
au;5;Be a good citizen, download the app!
au;1;Can’t register - get to getting PIN number and app just spins.
au;4;I couldn’t get the thing to accept my phone number (yes, it was in right format). Scrolling thru comments and saw a comment about wifi. Turned off wifi and voila! It worked. This looks to be a bug that needs fixing. Or give people a hint on the app, would avoid a lot of frustration. Otherwise, great initiative.
au;5;The only problem it that the screen goes goes black when the phone is face down, if you’re using the phone in bed for example...
au;5;"Absolutely no problems.
No not listen to the naysayers."
au;1;I’ve tried about 6 times to get it to send me a confirmation PIN number, it just sits and spins and nothing is sent to me. I’m out.
au;1;The app says there is an error verifying my phone number. I know my phone number so it seems pointless that an app thinks it know better.
au;5;A lot fail to understand that the likes of twitter and Facebook already take so much data and sell it or use it to target you. This app saves lives and Data is only released if you authorise it. Easy to use, no fine print. Well done.
au;5;Best app ever
au;3;It won’t register my Australian mobile number to get my pin
au;1;Would not accept my number, I guess I’ll just get corona then.
au;5;"It’s taking ages for it to send me my pin. 
But hoping to get up and running soon. 🤗
Great idea. 👍👍"
au;1;Easy to load until I had to record my phone number. Then it all stops there. It doesn’t recognise my number, despite repeating the process a few times.
au;5;Recommending everyone to download
au;1;Just downloaded, and the app blinks between the first logo screen and registration screen!!
au;1;"I tried to sign up for the app and Cannot verify my contact number. 
So unfortunately can’t get to the next step."
au;5;Pretty boring app so far, not as fun as Facebook or Instagram but let’s see how it goes
au;5;Excellent idea!! Let’s stop the spread togeather
au;1;Have tried several times to register but keep getting “Error verifying phone number”.
au;5;Very informative and inspirational. Gets somewhat political near the end and you get sick of hearing the blokes point of view when he keeps butting in and talking over the Coronavirus app. We’ll done guys keep em coming!
au;1;This does not run in the background. So how can it work? I have apps that do this, monitoring my health, but this app doesn’t show up as running in the background. Seems like a dogs breakfast release
au;1;"While I applaud the Governments attempt to get this app in to the hands of Aussie citizens, the technical reality is that in its current state this app is useless. The technical constraints within iOS mean that this app must be open and in the foreground to function. The second that you do something else like open another app, take a phone call or lock your phone; this app no longer works at all. A disappointing false start."
au;1;I really really want to make this work but it won’t recognise my Australian mobile nos I have had for a zillion years so I’ll have to leave it for now - hopefully an update will address this
au;5;Privacy concerns aside and long term those will be exposed - both good and, bad but fixed. I’m happily using this app. Would never normally install this, but given the times it is needed.
au;5;This is a brilliant idea. It’s something everyone who has a comparable mobile device can do. Our medical front line have been doing so much now everyone else can do there bit. If your worried about the app tracking you the which it can’t . Why do you have a mobile phone. Your already been tracked by your phone manufacturer, service provided and other apps you’ve e downloaded.
au;1;Cannot verify my phone number
au;5;Why not make the app available on Apple Watch?
au;5;Easy to install, privacy documentation straightforward and clear.
au;5;This app is easy to use and enrolment will hopefully help us get things moving in the right direction. I hope the tin foil hats let us get on with it.
au;1;Why cant I remove the app from my phone
au;5;When so much is at stake, in terms of lives, livelihoods, all aspects of wellbeing and quality of life, I feel that downloading this app is the least that I can do. I am confident the limited data collected will not be misused and I found the app itself to be really quick and straightforward to download and set up. One of the other reviewers said to omit the ‘0’ when entering mobile numbers to fit with the international dialling format. Maybe this is why I did not experience the same issues as a few others. In any case, it is great to see so many people being proactive about downloading this app. Please let’s all work together and do whatever it takes to beat the coronavirus, look after our communities and help restore health to all aspects of our beautiful nation.
au;5;"Might not be perfect but more downloads will lead to faster easing of lockdowns.

Any social media app had more on you than this app every will. The privacy argument is null."
au;5;Setup was quick and easy. Ignore the ill-informed conspiracy theorists and download this app. It has great potential to save lives and keep Australia’s coronavirus cases under control.
au;5;"Dear users who have complained about the phone number not working, 
Try using international format perhaps? 
eg: +61412XXXXXX"
au;1;Won’t verify the phone number and provides no means to assist.
au;5;So easy to set up and use. Everyone’s worried about privacy but it asks for the absolute bare minimum of information. Everyone should be downloading.
au;5;We can get back to normalcy sooner. Just do your little bit.
au;5;"It’s a good initiative and the app is well considered and designed taking into account the turn around time required.

Not an expert, would a watch app be better considering the limitations of Bluetooth on a phone? Locked screen, background processing etc."
au;4;great initiative, just don’t like that the app has to be kept running.
au;1;"‘Please check your details and try again’
Using an Australian number and have tried the phone number variants (+61)04xxxxxxxx and (+61)4xxxxxxxx. Quite frustrating really. Cannot even register."
au;5;If this app helps to save lives why would you download it. Come on everyone let’s help each other
au;4;Please send me another code to update my information as the code you have sent me earlier had been expired. Thank you
au;5;Helping the rating out, people download the app and help the gov understand the full picture
au;5;You just put your name (don’t even have to use real name), and your age range (20’s 40’s etc). It doesn’t “track you” it just keeps track of all the people you go near, then if someone has it you find out right away not weeks later. Perfect!
au;5;Hi, I’m still using my overseas mobile number and can’t register as the app requires an Australian phone number. Most grateful if this can be updated, 🙏🙏
au;5;This is a fantastic app developed by the Australian government!
au;1;"best way to drain your phone's battery.

best way to get fined for looking at your phone while crossing the road

best way to lose your data"
au;5;Just do it for everyone’s sake.
au;3;Installed this morning and iPhone 11 Pro running hot after install. Turning off the app stops this issue. Within minutes the phone goes back to ambient temp.
au;5;Download the app ASAP. Don’t worry about your privacy, you don’t have a privacy when you dead anyways. So don’t be an idiot. Just download the app and help to stop the spread.
au;5;"For those getting an error ""Error verifying number"" try turning off your wifi and use mobile data instead that solved it in my case and of course no leading zero on your number."
au;5;Easy to set up. Got my message this morning to tell me it was working properly, that was good for me as verification that it was setup correctly. It will do that daily.
au;1;"Not sure what the app needs my mobile number for, so I stopped at step 2 of the sign up form.

If I need to be notified the app can just send a push notification. I don’t understand why it needs any personal information instead.

Waiting for a version that’s based on Apple’s/Google’s privacy-focused exposure notification system."
au;3;It’s a  McDonalds.
au;5;"Hints for those worried....

* The government has your details already through our tax and Medicare - just download the app. 

* The app isn’t using location data, just Bluetooth to see if you came near someone - just download the app.

* No one in the government is really interested in your personal conversations with your cat. The app doesn’t record them - just download the app. 

Be a part of something to get Australia back up and running. Just. Download. The. App 😊

If you’re still scared/paranoid, then don’t. But never complain about isolation or restrictions again."
au;5;Download and help us to reopen.
au;5;Stop trying to find faults - this is for our greater safety.
au;1;"Can’t get passed confirming my details. 
Have tried all the obvious things like number with 0 first then without.  Tried different personal details."
au;5;"Every little bit helps. 
Easy to download. 
Set and forget until the time comes that you get diagnosed or called to say you have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed.  Then the magic of contact tracing becomes so much easier. Who knows this could save someone elses life."
au;5;Just do it.
au;5;Data is stored on your phone encrypted and can only be accessed by a health professional with your permission. Also it doesn’t record personal information.
au;5;Is it worth entertaining the idea that when the app is installed but a user has not kept it active, and, or the Bluetooth bit, is not running, the app turns from its green colour scheme to another ‘alerting’ colour as part of its notification to the user?
au;5;Better be safe than sorry.
au;5;I’d like to thank the PO, BA, designer, content writer, developer, tester, QA, architect etc who know doubt worked some long nights to get this approved and out the door in such a small timeframe. I’m sure navigating it through risk, compliance and legal while still making it understandable was fun. From one who know what’s involved - I thank you!
au;5;Easy to download and set up.
au;5;"App runs in background

App works well and without a hitch now. Thanks for making it happen."
au;5;Im sure developers did the best for protecting Australians. Protect your family and colleagues from this virus.
au;5;As I was trying to fill in details the screen would fade to black and say COVIDSafe in the centre randomly and frequently, made it really difficult to fill it out. Might be enough to stop a lot of people from completing so maybe fix that up soon
au;5;Cmon if you worried about your privacy first delete your Facebook and then stop using your gmail. Ohh wait even this wont work they already profiled you... . JUST DOWNLOAD THE APP
au;5;"Guys, government is doing the right thing, support them !
rather than supporting instagram and fb with all your deep personal data."
au;5;I’m not really in a position to rate the app, but I have downloaded as I want to band together and get our lives back to something normal. Let’s look out for each other.
au;5;Great app, easy to use and quick to register
au;1;Drains your battery really fast.
au;5;Don’t be put off by the fearful and ill-informed. For all the paranoid conspiracy theories, the fact is this app shares nothing not already known. This will help Australia get back on track. I’m happy and confident to use this app.
au;1;"I am all for this app
I have an iPhone X
I am a HCW
APP not registering my number. Where do I get trouble shooting support?"
au;1;"Like others have mentioned, the screen goes dark with text “COVIDSafe”. You have to minimise the app and launch it again to view the actual UI but it goes dark again within 2 seconds. In its current status, the app is practically useless. 

10s Max
iOS 13.3.1"
au;4;"I don’t like this government, so I’m trusting they will do what they say- this time...
  Privacy hasn’t been a concern of mine - as yet - so I’m willing to take a risk for health if others, and hope information won’t be used against me.

No glitches for me.
Used 1% of battery so far.
Apple’s unique methods of hibernation of aps in background helps."
au;4;App will have an error during registration process when you submit your mobile phone and you used an alias name with a number in it. The error message will say “Error verifying phone number” which is not a helpful error message. To fix this, simply change your alias name and remove the numbers or possibly any other special characters in it.
au;5;Quick and easy to register, the FAQ’s are super helpful and nicely formatted.
au;5;Easy Set Up.. No Lag.. Works Fine on my iPhone XS..
au;1;Just said error to send me code.
au;5;Happy to help with early detection and all the hard work the government has done to minimise the transmission makes it worthwhile.
au;4;"The app currently only works when you have it open and your iPhone unlocked.

Apple does not allow app developers to access Bluetooth from the background - so as soon as you open a different app or lock your phone, this app doesn’t work. There is a change coming, but not for another week or so. Hoping this app is updated to take advantage of the change ASAP!"
au;1;Stop downloading this app if you want to keep your civil liberties fools
au;4;I’m happy to have the app, but it needs to run in background so we don’t know it’s there. I don’t need messages telling me to be safe etc.
au;5;Works great. Easy set up.
au;5;Well thought out and easy to install. Great job 👍
au;5;Super easy to use, consent is two-fold and a great measure to tackle covid-19.
au;5;App is easy to set up. Help save Australia
au;1;"Having the app active means Bluetooth hands free in my car doesn’t work.
I don’t want to risk a fine trying to do them right thing’....."
au;5;Set up on my iPhone X in less than a minute.
au;5;Took a minute to register. Very easy.
au;5;"extremely easy to use!  Very happy with the privacy setting. If you use google, facebook or any of those types of apps....they have so much more data on you than this app collects. 
Hopefully everyone will download and we can put a stop to this damn virus!"
au;3;The app won’t start if the phone connected to WiFi
au;5;Want Australia to be set free from lockdown? Digital CV19 contact tracking is essential to do this...
au;5;Signed up very quickly. I’ve seen reviews saying that the word CovidSafe keeps coming up on the screen. This happens when you tip your phone upside down, so the screen faces down, it is to safe power. So when signing up just try to keep your phone level or screen pointing upwards and it won’t happen. Hope this helps.
au;1;"Apple Car Play no longer works. 
Message says ‘The device can no longer be used as a source in “Media”. ‘
I want to do the right thing to help the community so hopefully the developer is reading this. Please fix ASAP"
au;5;Easy. No issue for Ip8. Hope they sort out the low power mode issue if there is one.
au;2;I can’t believe that an app for-the-masses only support iOS10+ what about all the millions of older phones. With such a high number of iPhones in Australia such a limit is unwarranted. Unjustifiable laziness. Please sort this out ASAP
au;5;Working fine now, keep Bluetooth on for it to work.
au;5;"Health authorities in Australia are doing a great job. 

App seems to use little battery, so no trouble at all."
au;5;App works great on iPhone 6S. I like it. All good for now.
au;1;Doesn’t seem to work on iPhone 8 Plus. I just get the starting splash screen and that’s it.
au;5;"I’m all set up ... whoo hoo🥳. This marvellous app was very simple to download and quick to register. I hope EVERYONE downloads it as it will keep us all safe AND ALIVE. I am satisfied the Australian Government has diligently built in all the checks and balances to make this site secure - even though we only have to enter the most basic information so we can be contacted if we unknowingly come into contact with a ‘carrier’ of the deadly virus. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 💐💐💐🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
* I would not be surprised in the least if other countries struggling to stop the carnage adopted this app."
au;3;The app seems to work, but it doesn’t lock the screen.  This can be a major security issue.  The advise is to “keep the app running”.  This will not be a good user experience to be forced to keep this app on the foreground, let alone remember to do it whenever we go out shopping.
au;5;App is really straight forward to setup and use.
au;5;It has a rough launch but has a easy set up and is simple to use. While on the topic it’s pretty entertaining to read the conspiracy theories in the other reviews. One guy was upset that it would send you a message if you came in contact with an infected person, claiming it an evil invasion of their privacy. Little by little I’m losing faith in people.
au;4;Fast and easy to set up, very user friendly. Only issue is that it drains battery life very quickly.
au;2;iPhone XS keeps flicking back to the loading screen. Other than that easy set up
au;1;Keeps coming up with an error on 3 out of 4 devices in my house, saying “error verifying phone number”
au;5;There’s no reason you shouldn’t get it
au;5;Thanks for helping to keep us safe
au;1;This app requires your screen to be unlocked and the app running to even work, which means reduced privacy and battery life and an inconvenience if you need to use other apps. It’d be much better to use the Exposure Notification API from Apple than rushing this out.
au;1;Can’t get past number verification. Apparently doesn’t work on apple
au;5;"It worked without issues on an iPhone XS. to those that espouse issues around privacy just remember that your decisions have ramifications beyond just you. If this fails then it’ll fail because people like you are choosing to make it fail. Let me know later if privacy is that important while passing away from COVID because we as a country couldn’t trace the person you caught it from due to oercieved privacy issues.

For those that have highlighted technical issues around the software you are letting perfection be the enemy of fit for purpose. I want this now, not in 4weeks time. I’m not employed by the Federal or State Government's directly or as a contractor. I am an IT guy."
au;1;Doesn’t let me consent to registration. The tick box stays blank and I can’t move to the next page.
au;5;Let’s all do this WA. Other apps you use every day track more info about you than this one does. No problems down loading was quick and easy.
au;5;"It doesn’t track you just bounces your Bluetooth.
Plus the gov really couldn’t care less about tracking you Karen. So just instal the app. It’s 30 seconds."
au;5;Good initiative by Scott Mo, good job so far
au;5;"Less than 30 seconds to install and register.
If you have ever had anything to do with Aus Gov they already have more info than this app provides them with. I used a pseudonym no problem.
It doesn’t ask to use your location services (so no, it’s not a ‘tracking app’) it only uses Bluetooth signals to ping off other app users (that’s why it asks you to keep app running in background and Bluetooth on). 
You enter your mobile number so if a user is diagnosed and they upload their data which has used Bluetooth to ping other users (in close proximity for more than 15mins) by putting our mobile numbers in, it allows the health dept. to be able to contact us, not by using a location service. 
If you have any app on your phone that uses location services it’s more invasive than this one.
You have to upload your data for it to be accessible, otherwise it is kept on your phone.
Even if it did use location services (which it doesn’t) I’d rather give access to the govt of my location for a couple of months than potentially be in ICU, or be responsible for someone else being in ICU."
au;1;Just continuously says there is an error with my mobile number.
au;1;Have tried several times to activate this app continues to come up with error verifying phone number, so far I’d rate zero
au;5;Thanks🙏
au;5;"To everyone who has downloaded this App.
Thank you so much for being a responsible Australian citizen and caring about our nation’s health.
You will make a difference!"
au;1;"Not sure why the app will not recognise my number.

Tried to register but unfortunately can’t use this app"
au;5;Awesome app easy to register, Everyone please download for the benefit of entire Australia Cheers!
au;1;"Was looking forward to using, however, can’t register passed entering my mobile phone number.. 
“Error verifying phone number”

Using iPhone 8"
au;3;Continual notification about Bluetooth possible not on as the app is not pinging any other bluetooth device, cause I’m keeping my social distance.  If it keeps happening I will delete.  And why release before safe guard legislation is in place that was a dumb mistake
au;5;Worth doing to get the country back on its feet. Location data is not shared, your privacy is kept intact (people have already explored the code to find out). Get this app and save some lives!
au;5;The more who download the safer we are.
au;5;"Easy to install and use. Installed in less time than it takes to properly wash your hands. 
Do something good for yourself and your community by installing and using this app."
au;5;I trust the government in trying to stop the spread - in full support of this app and thankful that they have released it so soon it works well and uses bluetooth to locate you - not location services!! stay home, save lives and stop the spread !!
au;5;"Easy to download and Follow Info.
No issues"
au;3;Keeping the app running is not ideal at all it should be able to run the the background. Otherwise a fantastic idea
au;1;No issues with privacy, however only taking Bluetooth links when within 1.5 meters of someone for 15minutes doesn’t seem wide enough parameters considering speed of spread. Might lead to more ignorance on both sides, government and general public.
au;5;If we all download it we will help protect each other
au;2;"Error verifying phone number when using a VPN. Tried both with and without the leading 0. 

I have read the commentary and though sceptical of the government’s goodwill and competence (which is why I use a VPN) I have decided I want to use this app. 

Couldn’t register until I disabled the VPN."
au;5;"Works fine! 
Let’s get this done together so we can all go back to our normal lives!"
au;5;Works without a drama, just had to wait till the registration went live a few hours after app hit stores
au;5;So easy to set up!
au;2;From a UX point of view I wish they had of led with the why and not the how to begin with when installing the app. An overwhelming amount of information at the beginning and having to swipe through all of that didn’t make the key message clear or incentivise installation. It’s an important tool at this time and should be simplified for those who aren’t patient or tech savvy.
au;1;Installed on an iPhone 6S. Every few seconds, the screen goes black with the words COVIDSafe in the middle of the screen.
au;5;.
au;3;"The app appears to be linked to internal sensors.

As when app is open if you tip phone past the vertical, it blacks screen with COVIDSafe watermark
Ie Upside down. So laying down looking up at phone"
au;1;Stuck on black splash screen with COVIDSafe title. The actual app only occasionally flashes up, so have not been able to set up.
au;5;Why wouldn’t you download something that gives you peace of mind and protects yourself and others?
au;5;Loads easy, don’t worry about your location privacy, it’s a little price to pay for such a huge benefit ( savings lives, livelihoods and our beautiful country)
au;5;High hopes this app allows Australia to open sooner
au;5;Let’s do this and then quicker for all of us to get out of lockdown.
au;5;Does what it says it will do.
au;5;Works fine for me.
au;3;Great idea but in less than hour my iPhone XS battery has drained 44% with no other use. Makes having the app and leaving Bluetooth on unfeasible. Need to remember to turn it on when likely you come in contact making its efficacy questionable.
au;5;wish it can turn off Bluetooth while staying home or alone to save energy
au;3;"What does this statement actually mean - “app open in power saver mode""?"
au;1;You receive a PIN text to you, and have to enter that as a verification. I entered it and it states “not valid” contact health officer for another PIN. Couldn’t find anywhere to contact for this, so not wasting time stuffing around with it.
au;5;Make the app available for all country iTunes accounts because any person visiting or a visa holder probably has their home country iTunes and if you don’t make it available to them it will limit the info. 1.6million temp visa holders are currently in Australia so it’s worth doing
au;5;"Straight off the App Store, enter a few easy details and a couple op settings to accept. 

It doesn’t get much easier to help the country to get through this, and once it’s going you need to do nothing."
au;4;"Happy to provide less info than most common apps ask for, but please... I don't want notifications unless there is a problem... I don't need to be reminded to keep my bluetooth on, when it is in fact on... 

A notification just popped up and my heart rate spiked! I want to keep notifications on to be responsive... But your app is going to get deleted if you continue!"
au;5;"Left it running in background overnight on my iPhone 6 without charging. 82% at 11pm, 67% at 7am.
I can’t see any difference to power consumption."
au;5;Easy to install. Asks to send notifications. OK.  Asks to use Bluetooth. OK. Does NOT ask to use location services! Please Download and leave running in the background so we can get back to normal Australia!
au;5;Well done the best thing that has came out of this virus 🦠
au;5;Very necessary for the current situation.  I am glad to help to fight this virus.
au;5;Easy setup on iPhone X. More people that download the quicker we can get back to normality in Australia!
au;1;Get to the registration screen and before I can enter details the screen goes black with grey lettering saying “COVIDsafe”
au;5;Straight forward to download, voluntary to use, stay safe everyone #protectingourcommunity #beinformed
au;5;"I have downloaded app extremely easy, I would recommend 
Take 10 seconds"
au;5;Make it happen!
au;5;Very easy to use. If you’re concerned about privacy you can use a fake name. It’s legal.
au;5;Super easy to download and will help us all get out and about sooner!
au;5;Just downloaded it, you can take ya tinfoil hat off.
au;5;Easy to install and register. Hope this helps to relax restrictions.
au;5;Easy to download and enter info.
au;5;"This app is one of the best ideas the government has had so far! It is easy to download and once you have done that, You don’t have to do anything else! 
Stay safe! 
Ps. Everyone wash your hands and only go out of your house if you need too!"
au;1;Can’t even register - never received the sms containing the PIN. Tried many times, even uninstalled/reinstalled. This is what you get when these things are rushed for release. 😔
au;1;My, Australian registered mobile phone number is not acceptable for some unknown reason. I have tried several times.
au;5;"Imagine if we’d all had this app, when those people were allowed off the ship. 
Or before it went through the nursing homes, or the entire country."
au;5;No issues, easy install setup. Keen to support the community together
au;5;Our numbers are down compared to other countries because of the government 's effort such as these..
au;1;The step which is supposed to send an sms for pin verification doesn’t work. Could be an issue with sms gateway & Vodafone. SMS never comes have tried 10+ times.
au;1;Cannot find link to raise support ticket. Please fix this - surely a common issue for others. Thanks
au;1;Can’t validate phone number
au;5;This app is very easy to set up on your phone. Download it to help with contract tracing
au;5;Not sure what technical difficulties others are having but mine was smooth from start to finish. Good UX.
au;5;It hardly takes 45 seconds to do everything.
au;3;Corona
au;5;Lose the hysteria. All the big corporations have way more information and I’m sure they sell it on. This app will help us get the jump on COVID which is exactly what we need
au;5;Gutten Tag iz za wokinz za fine
au;5;Easy install and doing our bit for the nation
au;3;Very buggy to start with please fix bugs
au;5;No problem here quick set up let’s ease the restrictions
au;5;Come Australia let’s do this.   The sooner we have a way to quickly identify those at risk and need of isolation, the sooner we can get back to work and play!
au;1;Every couple seconds the screen blackens and just says covid safe. Not allowing me to read/access or report issues with all its flashing
au;4;"The government’s contact tracing app seems fine, but there’s a hiccup with the blue button at the bottom you can press to send your data to the health authorities when requested. 

The app designers have (I assume) assumed that you will only press this button if you test positive to covid-19, so the first thing it says is “you have tested positive for covid-19”. 

Facebook is already awash with misunderstandings about how the app works and what it does so I’ll be curious to see whether there are edge cases wherein people see this and assume that there’s a database somewhere showing them as infected."
au;3;Can not enter a mobile number as will say it can’t verify, so can’t register
au;1;Can’t get past mobile number
au;2;Pin to verify was sent, auto added but then doesn’t work - then won’t deliver new pin :/ It has corona virus.
au;5;Works very well
au;4;"My only gripe is that the upload my information button should have had a few steps/warnings  before allowing to press the button. 
I can lots of people clicking that button accidentally and then being told they are positive."
au;5;No problems. The sooner we all do this, the better!
au;5;"iPhone 11 Max Pro, super easy required far less information than other apps. Didn’t even ask for e-mail address.  
I work in construction and believe that this app gives me the best chance to keep those at home I love safe by alerting me of any risk that I should be concerned about that I would otherwise be unaware of."
au;2;App would not accept my phone number until wifi and VPN were switched off.
au;5;"It’s only keeping details of your proximity to any other mobile with same app, need blue tooth on.

We need this technology to quickly respond to any new breakouts - but like the disease, we need the majority of aussies to be using it."
au;1;The screen goes black for every few seconds making it impossible to use. I am on iPhone X.
au;1;During registration, screen goes black with covidsafe word and can’t continue process.
au;5;I find it easy to access. Definitely recommend it to others. Good friend of mine sent it to me and I shared it with my family and friends. Hopefully soon this will over and we’ll be back to our everyday life😊 Thanks for creating this app😇
au;4;Just runs in the background. I assume it works...
au;5;Alleged privacy concerns are trivial in the face of our safety and economy. Please encourage others to load.
au;5;Downloaded and run it but it never sends me a pin to activate and use it. Help please.
au;3;Have to remember to turn wifi off - it’s the only way it finally accepted my mobile number- thanks to other reviewer for highlighting this.
au;5;Like this idea and happy to help but wasn’t working. Stuck on splash screen. Half an hour later it was fine. A temporary glitch obviously
au;5;Unbelievable how well it works. Definitely a must for anyone wanting ScoMo to expedite the lifting of social distancing restrictions 💁🏼‍♂️
au;1;It won’t verify my mobile number
au;5;I downloaded the covid19 safe app on my iPhone 7 and it seems to work well. The only details you need to share is Full Name, Phone number, post code and age range then you need to make sure Bluetooth is on at all times when you are out and about. I am somewhat concerned about privacy breaches, but hoping my privacy is safe.
au;5;This app is all about saving lives so please install on your iPhone. I did so immediately when it went live, and it works fantastically. Your privacy will be safe, but please think of everyones health and safety first as a priority. Think of your family, your friends, and what you can do to help.
au;5;Does what it’s supposed to do. Works well so far. Download it and help Australia get on its feet faster.
au;5;With all the talk about security I’m comforted knowing that the app does not track my location, only my proximity to other users with the app activated.
au;1;"App requires iOS 10..... 
Must be thousands who would like to have the app but can't install it!"
au;1;"I have no idea if I have registered for the conavirous app
It sort of appeared on my phone (I am not sure what I actually pressed to )BUT I have not downloaded any of the data said to be required such as phone number date of birth etc
So am I registered and if so how do I check this and if not what do I need to now do?"
au;1;Seriously can’t believe this
au;5;The Government have your name, phone number and postcode anyway. So why not use the app to help everyone? People seem ok to give these details to Facebook and dating apps but not an app that can save lives?  Hmmmm makes you wonder. Do it for it for you’re community.
au;5;Quick easy install, clear instructions, no problems registering. Top work on short notice. Will be an important tool for tracing work of our health professionals.
au;5;I’m the suspicious type, but their Privacy Policy explains you don’t need to use your real name. Doesn’t use GPS. No address information. The only accurate information required about you is your phone number.
au;5;Very easy to setup, less than 1 minute. Let’s keep Australians safe. So glad we have this app.
au;5;"Worked fine on my XR. Very easy setup.

I particularly liked that I can put a fake name. I guess the Govt only need to know location and other app users in my radius when I am out and about."
au;5;Simple to set up
au;5;A piece of cake to register and go operational. No problems whatsoever. Easy!
au;5;If you are lying in bed trying to use this app with your phone above your face then you might only see the splash screen... tilt your phone up! Looks to me like the devs switch to a low power image when you tilt the phone.
au;4;It Installed & setup with no problems.
au;1;The app does to show on iPhone XS Bluetooth menu if you have other applications open. Needs work.
au;5;I’ve got a 11 pro max and it’s easy and fast, no hiccups or bugs app works fine.
au;5;Works great! Update your phone if you’re having issues.
au;5;Do your bit and help us all get back to work
au;5;Works fine. Easy to setup. Looks like those who had issues verifying mobile attempted before the app was live.
au;5;"After providing mobile number for verifications, the words ‘wrong number?’ shows up. These words wrongly send the message to people that they’ve entered the wrong number but it’s only asking if you’ve entered wrong number. This needs to be changed to ‘didn’t receive code?’  
I had to explain that to someone so that may be why people are thinking they can’t verify their number. If you receive a code it means your phone number is verified."
au;5;I am safe now yay
au;5;Keeps telling me I’ve got wrong phone format. Trying lead zero and without. iPhone 11. Very frustrating.
au;5;Easy to install, look forward to the protection it provides. Look after yourself, your family, friends and community.
au;5;The app permissions deem this to be safe app despite giving data to the government. Whether it works or not is another matter, but for the most part it’s well designed.
au;5;Easy to setup. Thank you for looking after the community. Great initiative.
au;5;Very easy. Let’s do our part!
au;1;Like so many others my phone number failed to verify. Tried turning off wifi as suggested by others but to no avail. Will affect uptake if they release a glitchy product. Can’t be that hard right????
au;5;Super quick and easy to get going. Only took a minute. Hope everyone else gets it as well.
au;5;"I have had no issues with installing this app and registering took 20 seconds. 
There has been no impact on the phone battery life."
au;1;"I was under the impression the data this app generates and my personal information would only be used for COVID19 tracking.   But the fine print tells a different story. Pretty disappointing.
In the Privacy Policy it says:
We will also use or disclose your personal information to:
ensure the proper and lawful functioning of COVIDSafe
if it is necessary, prosecute a breach of the law in relation to contact tracing under the Biosecurity Determination and the Biosecurity Act 2015"
au;5;Easy, takes 30 seconds to install and will save lives. Get it now
au;1;The introduction screen flashes up and is unable to be retrieved regardless of battery settings, brightness modes or manual/auto brightness selection.  Surely this App would have been Beta tested?
au;3;You can get passed the black COVIDSafe issue by tilting the screen or laying the iPhone on a flat surface.  As soon as you do this the black screen disappears and you can complete the registration process.
au;2;Hey guys, keen to see an update as this app will help our country a lot. Keeps reverting back to black splash screen randomly. Can’t complete registration. Can you please look into this? Thanks and keep up the good work!
au;3;"First reaction.. who approved the copy?!!
 
When clicking through to the “upload my information page” please, PLEASE, change the copy to:

“If you have been asked my a health professional to upload information related to your coronoavirus test, please continue. This will help us with tracing.

Unless you consent...”"
au;1;Won’t even let me register
au;5;Had some issues yesterday but all fixed now
au;4;"For everyone who is concerned about the government tracking your location, you gave up your privacy the moment you were added on a birth certificate. Stop wearing your tin-foil hats and giving yourselves so much credit that your data is even interesting in the first place lmao 

If you don’t want to have the government finding you, live off the grid. 📡

As for the issue of community tracing for the virus, I think this is a great idea to make sure we’re all safe and let us able to trace something that is so difficult to do so beforehand."
au;5;"Simple registration and had it up in under a minute.  

It amazes me the people who get on their soapbox when they don’t or simply can’t be bothered learning how the app has been architected. A FB comment summed everything up as “it was built in America by Amazon, they took our jobs and are storing data there!!”

For those who want to learn.. Amazon Web Services provide storage.. but with a core data centre based in sydney that Govt as well as banks are other firms needing reliable but secure cloud storage. It’s not Amazon retail and the app was built here as seen by the various articles citing Govt hiring developers. 

I’m not associated with the app but I do build apps and it’s frustrating when ill informed user fear-mong those who genuinely want to make use of it and help fellow Aussies out."
au;1;"Leave them on for longer.......
Keep turning off - iPhone 11"
au;1;Can’t get passed the verification page. Says check details when attempting to verify.
au;5;Doesn’t work if VPN is enable in your phone. So disable VPN first
au;5;App needs to specify to leave ‘0’ off mobile phone number.
au;5;Great steps against fight agaist covid19
au;4;Could not get past the splash screen. I had a dozen or more items in my Bluetooth list. I removed a few unused items and could then get past splash screen and register OK
au;5;Great idea. It will help you get an early warning of contact with a confirmed case so you can warn your family, fellow workers, friends and health workers. Encourage and help everyone to install this app and to keep it running.
au;1;Have tried to delete and restart but it still won’t open.
au;5;"Worked fine, too easy
Let’s give this Kung flu the chop!"
au;4;Thanks for the app... It would be nice to see some form of activity on the app once it is running, both as interest/encouragement and as a way too show that it is working. Maybe some form of chart?
au;5;Otherwise works fine.
au;5;"Brilliant install but may need clarification on two points:
Drop the first 0 when adding your mobile number
Keeping the app running...? I presume it runs in the background as long as I don’t delete it."
au;5;Turn off all over apps and try a couple times
au;5;Downloaded, read the privacy policy, registered. Took all of 5 minutes. Hoping this enables life to resume some sort of normalcy.
au;5;Worked perfectly, very simple app, easy registration, privacy factor thought out well, I am grateful to have it!
au;1;Haven’t we already slowed the spread and flattened the curve? It’s all just a massive overreaction. Give our lives back and stop this hypocrisy!
au;5;App is simple and affective. Let’s do our part to keep our community safe.
au;5;Easy setup! All the 1 star reviews must be user error
au;5;There was an initial problem with verifying my mobile, that has now been fixed.
au;1;App is broken, can't even progress past the 'CovidSAFE' splash screen most of the time, and during signup if you're able to get that far the the splash screen keeps popping up when trying to enter information.
au;1;Keeps telling me there’s an error with my phone number.  Have deleted app and reloaded several times it still won’t recognise my number
au;5;Quick and easy. Let’s get out of our homes by downloading this app.
au;5;"All seems good to me, other apps and web sites know more about you anyway, so many other apps out there that trace you! If this app reduces the current lockdown we are all in then it has to be for the better. 
My concern is remembering to have the app running in the background and my battery life, if it reduces my battery quickly unfortunately it’s gone."
au;1;Every couple of seconds the screen goes blank except says COVID safe. Makes it difficult when filling out information because it does this glitch.
au;5;Took about 1 minute to set-up, easy and fast.
au;1;Flicking on my iPhone X.
au;5;Easy to set up, works perfectly in the background
au;5;It took less than a minute to register, very easy to do. Come on Australia, let’s beat this thing!
au;1;Can’t use
au;2;"Wanted to register while overseas, but consistently getting an error message saying to check my phone number (entered correctly)
Want to support, but unable to register."
au;5;Very quick and easy to install. As I always have Bluetooth on, I don’t need to make any orher changes to my phone👍
au;5;This app is to help us. Please download.
au;5;Great app works well, it does not track your location.. it tracks the people who have been in contact with you in the last 21 days.
au;5;Signed up without any problems in under 60 minutes. Doing my bit! Get on board Australia!
au;5;Hope more people install it
au;2;"What happens if both married partners only use one telephone number?
No one seems to know."
au;3;Read the reviews and saw one that removed the number from their name to make it work. Did the same and Hallelujah - worked immediately.  Why can’t that simple rule be explained at the point of entry? When I tried at 6pm there were nearly 1,000 negative  reviews - all having their mobile rejected 🙁
au;5;Took all of 20 seconds to register. Too easy.
au;5;"Will the challenges around the world we have faced in 2020, this app helps health professionals in being able to stop the spread of the dreadful coronavirus. 
Easy to register with just a name, age range, postcode and phone number."
au;5;Can’t believe the number of people coming here to rate the app 1 star because the phone verification “isn’t working”... have you ever signed up to anything before? When there is a country code at the start drop the zero off of your phone number, do this and the verification works without a problem. Don’t waste people’s time writing negative reviews, just learn to think for yourself or do some simple googling 🙄
au;1;Very quick but the words COVIDSafe kept coming up. Bugs need fixing
au;5;Used mobile number without 0, and you are on highway!
au;5;Easy to setup. I have nothing to hide so what’s all the fuss about.
au;5;All the safeguards seem there for privacy. Easy setup/sign up. I’m keen to know if I’ve been exposed
au;2;"Had no issue with registration, done in 30 seconds. 
However, tested the tap of updating information, it required a pin from text message to proceed, tried several times, never received a text, then the app got frozen 
This needs to be fixed ASAP"
au;5;Very fast to download and set up. Only took me a 1-2minutes
au;5;Very easy to register, great idea, thanks for helping to keep us safe.
au;1;Can’t get past the splash screen, tried killing and restarting app multiple times
au;5;Quick & easy 10/10
au;1;On the iPhone XR it is very glitchy. Hard to add details in and has a constant black screen saying COVIDSafe
au;1;There is a bug with verifying your phone number when on WiFi. I could pass that step as soon as I turned WiFi off!
au;5;I could install this and easily register. Well designed. Great work!
au;5;Worked fine, fast download and easy sign up. Let’s all do our park to help stop the spread. Paranoid conspiracy theorists are the enemy of the rest of society.
au;5;Took me a while to set up, because I'm a boring dum dum with no sense of humour.
au;4;It’s simple to setup, and explains everything well. Obviously, there is a privacy concern to the app, but if handled well, it shouldn’t be an issue. It appears that many of the negative reviews here are due to people trying to register before verification opened, causing errors.
au;5;Very easy to set up. Glad to see this sooner or later
au;5;Takes about 30 seconds to set up, anyone can do it even my 72 year old dad
au;3;Why so glitchy? And what’s this about, leave the app open? Does that mean that I can’t close it from running in the background? This will chew my battery 🙄 But... I do wish to know if I come into contact with anyone who tests positive
au;5;What a way to keep us all safe! Hopefully this can save many more lives!
au;1;Won’t even let me register
au;4;"Easy install but not sure whether it needs to be running to work. The app is not clear about this. I don’t like apps running in the background so I usually kill off any non current apps. 
More information required."
au;5;App download was easy. Let’s get through this pandemic together!
au;5;Took barely a minute to read the last few reviews, followed them to a “T”, and it worked like a charm
au;5;Privacy looks good. Everything is encrypted, not even users can see the information collected.  When entering your phone number drop the first ‘0’ of your number as +61 has already been entered.  Age range is to enable prioritisation of those to contact first, and Post Code so they know which State should’ve contacting you.
au;5;Easy to sign up. App appears to take privacy seriously
au;5;Super easy to register! Let’s work with it together!
au;5;"Easy to find and download.
Took less than a minute to set up."
au;1;Does not work
au;5;Installed and signed up in a matter of minutes. Easy to use.
au;5;After that it was smooth sailing. Happy to do my bit for Team Australia.
au;5;"Absolutely easy to install and use. 
Grow up and download it !"
au;5;"I’m a sceptic when it comes to government apps but I read the Privacy Policy and felt reassured that I could use a fake name, only asked for my age range, postcode and phone number. I was reassured my location is not tracked or recorded and it’s deleted every 21 days. The app only works on Bluetooth signal strength vicinity to record distance from potential infected people. Reassured and feel like I’m doing my bit for my friends, family and country co I can be contacted ASAP if I came close to anyone who ends up infected.  Brilliant bit or technology actually. I turn off at night when I’m sleeping into ‘Airplane Mode’ so it not emitting signals while I sleep.  

If you’re an Aussie and care you’d download it too and delete this app in a month or so when this all blows over!  😜🍻"
au;5;Very simple, even for us oldies! Once you sign in you don’t need to worry about anything! Just set and forget.
au;5;No issues. Signed up and running. Easy. Great info on the registration screens. Just a name a phone number required. No GPS. Excellent. Much better than Facebook and google who ask you for your first born and track your every search keyword, date of birth, every travel-movement, your friends, your family .... etc. come on everyone - get on board. Such a simple low risk thing to keep us all safe. Stay safe everyone.
au;5;Easy to install and register, good app! Well done feds! Keeping all safe!
au;5;Simple to install and activate. Clear details on how data will be used and privacy protections in place.
au;1;"Can’t even verify my number. Tried it 10 times.

Useless app."
au;2;"The notifications about whether the app is active or not don’t seem to be consistent.
In the first hour, turning off Bluetooth set off a notification advising that the app was not working, but several hours later after toggling it, it doesn’t do anything.
The inability to work in the background is just poor too."
au;5;Phone number verified successfully. Thought people should know that it works now.
au;1;Does not work, all I get is a blank black screen with COVID in the middle.
au;4;Just amazing that this is even possible. App works well and is stable. I made a small error when entering my details in a rush and there is no obvious way to correct it, otherwise solid.
au;5;Quick and easy to sign up. Instant phone verification. Stay safe everyone.
au;5;Registration is the only thing you need to do and it’s simple. Please download it.
au;5;The app was super easy to install and get up and running.  😊
au;1;"Claims your data is private unless you release it, but they can contact you if someone sick walks past you... so they clearly have your phone number and location by that time.
Current privacy legislation does not preclude changes allowing future data release or leaks.
Not a reflection on the developers, the product owner is untrustworthy."
au;5;"I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1, 
I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all.

There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number, as well as the ‘continue’ button the ‘verily phone number’ text was also showing, however the ‘continue’ was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately.

As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number.

We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased.  So please install the app and use it.

To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major
reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later.

Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths, so please use the app, follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water.   

May we all emerge safe and well, however we must all do the right thing."
au;4;"Downloaded and registered without issue. Lots of people tried to register before the start time of 4pm AWST and ended up with error and frustration. 
I would like to see a data count on the app to show how many people I have been closer than 1.5 metres and 15 minute duration. 
This will give me indication that the app is working on my phone and I can verify the numbers I have in close proximity. 
If the number is too high that expected, then I may want to think how should I further distancing myself from others in public areas."
au;5;Worked without a hitch. Just make sure when prompted to enter your phone number to leave out the first 0 otherwise it will not work. (Standard when asked for your phone number and our country code +61 is already entered.)
au;5;No problems setting up - took 2 minutes
au;4;"There’s social benefit here for everyone. The Sth Koreans used something similar with success.

Now it’s our turn. Cmon 🇦🇺 Australia 🇦🇺"
au;5;"You can register your number fine, people just ignored all of the instructions and didn’t wait until 6pm when registration opened. 

Your data is safe, there’s a 5 year gaol term for anyone who accesses it for any reason, even through a court order, and you can use a fake name if you want (I have), no other private details are required other then a post code and a phone number. 

Pls download this app. The eyes of the world are upon us to witness the first major country to beat the virus, we’re almost there."
au;5;Fast and easy to sign in, please share and help stop this virus.
au;5;Done in a minute, drop the 0 from your mobile number.
au;5;Registration worked fine with no problems at all, very quick and easy to install.  Let’s all help each other to beat this virus.  Install now.
au;5;I see many people saying they can’t get the app to work because they can’t verify their mobile number. I had no trouble with my setup. The app did throw up an error when I entered the first 4 digits of my mobile number starting with 0414, but if I just entered 414 (No zero as the first digit) and then entered the rest of the numbers it verified and sent me a pin # to enter on my iPhone. If you tried imputing your mobile number without the first zero and it didn’t work, then I would assume it was an overload error on the server with this app currently ranking as the #1 downloaded app in the Apple App Store.
au;5;People reporting number issues should retry as it now works, simple and easy to setup
au;5;Looking forward to seeing how this app works in the coming days. The usage is explained quite clearly.
au;5;I downloaded the app and setup ID on first night of release. Smooth easy process. No problems with verification.  Wonderful to have this app to assist in contact tracing.  I highly recommend it. Keeps us all safe!
au;5;"Sure this app may save lives. But what about the untold cost to privacy?

What will this mean for drug dealers, already struggling to reorganise their supply chains after having been hit by the pandemic? It may surprise you to hear that many are not covered by the force majeure clauses that you and I take for granted.

And what about men who cheat on their wives. As if it wasn’t hard enough for them to do so in self-isolation, now they will have to worry about the government tracing app. Think of the plight of Barnaby Joyce for one.

Yes, this app may help us return to some degree of normalcy in society. Yes, it may allow us to share more time with friends and family, to free the aged from a terrible period of isolation. Yes, it may help restore employment and self-fulfilment to the millions who have been rendered unemployed by the virus.

But I ask you, is it really worth the cost?"
au;5;A monkey would be able to sign up to this with no problems
au;5;Registered without any issues hope the country does the right thing and helps us beat this thing!
au;5;Works perfectly
au;5;See people having problems with phone numbers - entered mine minus leading zero , got message with 6 digit code, entered - all seems ok👍
au;5;"Have trouble with your mobile number? 

You tried to sign in before 18:00 26/04.

Have another go..."
au;5;Easy to set up, looking good so far, hoping I’ll never get an alert that I’ve been near a covid case but at least if I do I’ll be able to have a proactive reaction
au;5;Just leave to 0 off the front of your mobile number👍
au;5;Registered entered phone number and received PIN. It works fine if you don’t try and do it before it goes live.
au;5;Obviously they have ironed out the initial gremlins
au;5;30 secs to set up.  Glad this is out and look forward to how it goes
au;5;On hearing the conditions put on the data collected and the fact that the code is open source, I really cannot think of any extra steps the government could take to protect my privacy. I am an app developer and definitely no supporter of the current prime minister.
au;5;accepted my phone number - how many people entered the 0 at the start of their mobile number i wonder?? if the +61 is already entered, you don’t enter the 0 of your mobile number
au;5;iPhone 10, all good no issues.
au;5;Easy registration process. Hoping to contribute fight against the deadly enemy!
au;5;I had no problems installing..many here did but I think it’s because they forgot to drop the zero when entering their mobile phone number..
au;5;The process was smooth and quick
au;5;Both my wife and I registered without any issue. Hopefully the app will help us all get back to normal sooner :-)
au;5;When you see the +61 then drop the 0 from the front of your number :/
au;2;I installed this hoping to recommend it but currently this is not really useful as it closes after a bit of using Facebook, gmail and twitter so it takes too much clicking to keep it alive. Also died while I was just listening to podcasts. If you can update it to the tracking API thingo that apparently can solve this.
au;5;"Quick and easy to set up
Simple to understand 
Thank you for keeping our country safe"
au;5;I’m dismayed to read some people are having tech issues with the app. But glad it’s the only thing stopping them from downloading. We must all do our bit.
au;5;"Simple to register and easy to use.

Also wondering how many of the negative reviews are legit or Russian bots?🤷‍♂️"
au;5;App works just fine for me, was able to successfully register (as opposed to what some other reviews say.) Stay safe everyone :)
au;5;"Please note that to enter your mobile number with +61 in front you have to drop the 0 
I entered my number and accessed the app straight away.
All done now and I feel a lot safer now."
au;4;Just so need up, use the last 9 digits of my mobile number (dropped the zero at the start) got the test straight away and now have the app up and running. Perhaps there was an issue with everyone signing up at the start at the same time?
au;5;It’s important that we all install this app! Please disregard the previous comments regarding SMS not working. Prior to 6pm AEST 26-Apr, it is reported that registrations had not been enabled, hence why some people couldn’t get through. It now works perfectly.
au;5;Seriously worried about the average IQ of some reviewers - works just fine...if you follow the instructions correctly and drop the ‘zero’ from your number 😐
au;5;"To all those people who tried uploading it too soon (before 6pm on 26/4) - try again. 
It’s a breeze."
au;5;Perfect, no problems loading, very simple!
au;5;People need to use their brains. App works fine. Don’t put the 0 in when entering your mobile number. It staggers me that people clearly have no clue. Well done Federal and State Govt for this app .
au;1;Can’t get passed the phone number verification
au;5;I was able to register unlike the thousands that said it’s not working. Perhaps the issue is resolved now. Anyway here’s to the government tracking me as I sit on the couch
au;5;Technology that enhances public health. Works for me.
au;5;Easy to install. No problem with phone number.
au;5;Working effectively now, as I just signed up.
au;5;"No phone number issue
Are your phones up to date?"
au;5;No problems setting up
au;5;No reason to not install. And it’s probably good to be able to say yes rather than no when the health guys come calling.. ✅
au;5;This should help reduce the risk of being infected.
au;4;Guess everyone typed 0 as well for phone number where as should have started with 4 as the country code prefix is already part of the app.
au;5;Some people have complained it’s hard to set up and can’t put their phone number in. Thus they have given it a 1star rating.  I think they must have fixed it all now as it worked without a hitch.
au;4;It had some issues seems to be working now.
au;1;Won’t allow me to complete the setup of the app as my mobile number is being rejected even though my phone number with and without the leading zero has been entered correctly. Clearly a bug at play. May want to get that sorted out before on you roll it out to the masses.
au;5;Very easy to install, remove the first 0 of your mobile number (+61 4** *** ***)
au;1;If you are here on a visa from another country, and don’t have an Australian App Store account, it’s not available to download. Which is reaaally dumb. Please fix.
au;5;"The app works fine and registration was easy. 

Instructions on the official websites stated that the registration would be available after 6pm. Everyone who had issues with phone number verification were trying to register prior to that time."
au;5;"Saw a bunch reviews stating people couldn’t register their mobile number. 

Registering couldn’t have been easier.

After the 61+ when you enter your mobile don’t include the zero at the front!!"
au;5;Accepted mobile phone number instantly. Fully registered. Fingers crossed this helps our fight against Covid-19. Stay at Home!
au;5;No problems registering number. All seemed smooth. Seems like early teething issues are now fixed.
au;5;Love it if ..... it will Just get me out of Isolation
au;5;Took less than a minute to register.
au;5;Works great installed and set and forget. Phone number is to be verified without the 0 in front
au;5;No problems creating the account, and verifying the phone number. If you are having an issue use +614... don’t put 04...
au;4;"Like everyone else it didn’t verify my phone number, so my initial review was the first disappointed one.  But they’ve since fixed the issue and it’s up and running.
I can’t give it five stars because the jury is still out on it working or not.  But it’s easy to sign up for (now) and fingers crossed that it helps Australia continue to hold the virus at bay."
au;1;Reinstalled and problem still exists
au;5;Bugs must be fixed, worked well for me
au;5;Simple to setup. Let’s hope this will help get us back to normal.
au;5;I downloaded the app and was able to set it up within 2 minutes I see a lot of reviews saying that the app can’t verify there phone numbers I’m guessing that is due to to many people trying to do it at the same time and causing an overload to the servers
au;5;The problem with phone verification has been fixed and this is a great app to help protect Australians against COVID-19 please download!!
au;4;Leave the zero off the front of your mobile number and it’ll let you in! It already punches in the +61, so just add the rest, minus the first zero.
au;5;"Installed and register my mobile and my parents mobile without any issues.
Quick and easy process.👍"
au;5;Very easy to set up, all the complaints were from before the app was ready.
au;5;I can registered successfully, just enter your phone number without 0 in the front. Keep your bluetooth ON.
au;5;Straight forward install, clear instructions. No issues entering mobile number or verifying account.
au;5;"Install and registration without any issues. 
Lets keep AUSTRALIA Safe. 

STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19"
au;5;"Installed this without any problems 
Registration easy and successful 
This is the next step in making Australia a safer place and helping lift restrictions 
Just do it"
au;5;Make sure you put the leading 0 in your mobile number when verifying. Besides from that it just does what it says.
au;5;Signed up within minutes, no issues at all.
au;5;Those giving a one star clearly didn’t see that whilst the app was released today. You couldn’t register till after 6pm.  Registered fine.
au;5;I have had no issues with download and set up, contrary to lots of reviews
au;5;"Working, thank you.

Here’s hoping this will nail down the virus in Australia like we all expect."
au;5;No trouble installing. Finally feel like I can do something towards getting life back to normal.
au;3;Installed no problem maybe people are having trouble with the mobile screen because they are forgetting to leave out the 0 at the front of their mobile ?
au;5;The app is simple and easy to use. Even the Privacy Policy is easy to understand. What else is simple? Downloading the app to help keep your fellow Australians safe!
au;5;don’t go to cubicle 4
au;1;"As usual, system error on first go! Like everyone else is saying, won’t let me register my phone number.
All for the idea, but if you can’t get the basic registration right, it now concerns me about my data when before I wasn’t concerned in the least!"
au;5;I was able to quickly register my phone number to the app. No issues, not sure what is happening on other people’s mobile devices.
au;5;Simply follow the prompts and get your app registered.
au;5;Very quick and painless setup, informative too. Didn’t experience any of the number registration issues everyone spoke of here - they may have fixed it? 9:00pm 26/4
au;5;No idea what the other reviews are talking about... put your mobile number in without the 0 and it just works... let’s hope this app helps and everyone gets onboard!
au;5;"I did not have any problem signing up to the app, 
It seems though you guys are putting you number incorrectly.

Skip the 04— just put 4xxxxxxxx. And the rest of the number. Then see if it will work."
au;5;"Please start your mobile number with 0 and your verification SMS will come as per normal 

No issues with registering the app"
au;5;Literally took a minute to set up
au;5;To the people having a good moan, look at what the Parliament (both main parties) have done to keep us safe. Yes this is an app that may need some tweaks but to roll this out across the country I’m addition to everything else that is being done to keep us with one of the lowest rates in the world, well just have a little patience
au;5;Took less than two minutes from download to finishing registration. Great job!
au;1;Another one with error verifying phone number, I wonder if someone had actually managed to pass this stage?
au;5;Works fine, try again.
au;5;Easy to set up. Let’s hope it allows Australia to relax the lockdown faster.
au;5;Easy to install - seems everybody giving one star doesn’t know that +61 is followed by 4... so leave out the zero.
au;5;Simple registration and no map or anything, so very safe
au;5;No idea why people can’t register their phone numbers. Mine’s working and active as of 8:53pm 26/4 - Good thanks
au;5;Downloaded. It’s working.
au;5;Seems to have been fixed. Works perfectly well. Make sure you get everyone you know to sign up, and remember to drop the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number.
au;5;Easy sign up had no troubles at all. It’s great to see something like this come in effect to protect us all and help get our way of life back to normal and get the economy back up and going!
au;5;Anyone reading this, leave out the 0 at the start of your phone number and see if that works. So mine would be +61 412345862 or whatever instead of 04..... I had no issues verifying my mobile number at all.
au;5;Downloaded and all worked fine. Registered my mobile without any issues
au;5;No problems installing on iPhone 6s
au;5;No issue verifying number.
au;1;"no matter how many times i give it
permission it won’t recognise my bluetooth and fully activate and my bluetooth is always on to sync with my other gadgets...frustrating"
au;5;Worked fine for me. Got setup in under a minute. No idea what the others are going on about but they must be doing something wrong.
au;5;For all those that say it does not work, after the county code (+61) that is already entered, out your mobile number in but without the first zero. This is standard practice when entering a mobile number after a country code!
au;3;"I read here that many people can’t get past the phone registration. 
Here is a helpful reply.. 
drop the “0” at the beginning of your mobile phone number. 
For example, if your number is
0415 123 456
Then enter-
415 123 456
Done, easy peasy."
au;5;"Suggest collaborating with DTA to integrate both apps functionality or retiring the DTA app so only this app is downloaded.

There is the chance that users will download the DYA Coronavirus App thinking it is the COVIDsafe tracking app!"
au;5;All working well. Set up simple, fast, registered in under 60 seconds 👍
au;1;"The app would not pass the ‘ verify phone number screen ‘.  I changed my name to take out a number that was in there... I was supposed to be able to be anonymous.  Then it seemed to work.

The explanations of leave this on, do this, don’t close that are very ‘technical’ and not written for someone over, say, 50,  with limited understanding of some of the terminology used.   

There should be a simple test to tell me that I am using it correctly.

Also ,  I should be able to see people around me who have the app activated.  This would help me suggest uptake  to those who I can see may not understand."
au;5;For me the installation worked perfectly. No problems verifying my mobile number. I’m sure that any issues for others will be resolved in the next 24 hours
au;5;Downloaded the app and had to restart it to get it to go through the registration process successfully. All it needs it access to Bluetooth and Notifications - easy as!
au;5;"You must be entering your phone number incorrectly.

It needs to be entered by dropping the 0 - as you would if you were calling an Australian mobile from overseas.
For example 0412 345 678 would become
64 412 345 678.

I did this and I got the pin within 4 seconds of hitting submit."
au;5;Seamless, very straightforward and hopefully will help the health care front liners keep us safe 🤗😎😎
au;5;Most negative reviews are by folks who tried to register before the 6pm start time and wondered why the registration process didn’t work. Duh
au;5;Initially it could no recognise my mobile number to send a verification code. Obviously teething issue which they have sorted and all registered no problems now :)
au;5;Was set up in seconds. No more data then what we give Facebook etc so don’t see a problem in using it
au;5;Worked for me. Give it a try everyone to end lockdown.
au;5;Easy to load and register.... now let’s hope this thing helps us get out of these restrictions ASAP!
au;5;Very simple registration process, took no time at all. Did not experience any of the issues noted in other reviews.
au;5;Hardest part was finding covidsafe in App Store , lucky I went in through Aust covid virus app , no problem registering when it asked for mobile , code was sent straight away , let’s hope it saves lives .
au;5;Very easy to use & very basic information only required
au;5;Easy to download and sign up no problems
au;5;Not sure why it didn’t work for others but mine worked fine, mobile phone not an issue. Hope we’re all patient and this gets going so Aussie is #1 in the world where we should be!
au;5;"Join the fight 
Works now"
au;5;When registering your phone number, you do not need to enter the first 0 when entering immediately after a country code. Ie +61 4*******
au;4;Process was very quick. Got my verification code which was accepted and I am done.
au;5;I checked the location setting, indeed the app does not use the location service . No security concerns for me .
au;5;"Works, no issues. 
We should all download it, for the benefit of all Aussies!"
au;5;Installed and set up within two minutes.
au;5;"Simply looked at so many registration fails. Do not put zero at the start. It will send a pin code to your mobile. Insert the code and you are ready to go. 

The Wrong Number in blue is simply if you have entered the wrong number. Otherwise ignore it."
au;1;Can’t sign up because no PIN comes. Have had it sent three times - no joy.
au;5;App works well, hope this helps the nation.
au;5;Registration was easy, phone number accepted.
au;5;"I downloaded the app and everything worked out fine, simple easy verifying with six digit number sent to your phone.
You can delete anytime regardless, it’s not compulsory, so people need to chill out.
Can’t wait to go to the pub and back to the football in the hopefully near future!"
au;5;"Took less than a minute to enter everything and agree to the conditions.
Anything to help reduce the virus and get our lives back to normal."
au;5;Quick, easy to install and register, set and forget. 100% confidence. Stop worrying people this is a good thing.
au;1;First time opening it, it toggles between the registration and the word covidsafe with black background. Can’t get pass the rego as unable to fill up the fields due to constant quick toggles.
au;1;As mentioned in another review I am unable to get past entering my mobile number. It may be that servers are overloaded? or that in the rush to get it implemented inadequately tested?
au;5;Downloaded without a hitch. Works fine.
au;5;Worked for me 👍
au;5;super easy to sign up. feel like i was one of the only people without any issues.
au;5;A bunch of reviews from 5h ago say the phone number verification doesn’t work but it worked just fine for me.
au;4;For those who can’t get past the verify mobile screen, leave off the leading 0 of your number, it’s covered by the 61
au;5;Simple and easy to set up took less than 1 min
au;5;"Those people saying the phone number won’t accept ... whenever you enter a +61 phone number you take the 0 off.

Setup takes less than a minute"
au;5;Easy to setup. Get on board and do your bit. You may just save a life
au;5;Lots of people saying it won’t accept the mobile. For me it was seamless and worked first time - so maybe a bug was fixed. Suggest people try again.
au;5;For everyone saying your number wasn’t working, when it prompts you for your number you DO NOT include the zero at the start. If you number was 0412 345 678 then you should put the following after the 61.... 412 345 678. Hope this helps.
au;5;Took me less than 2 minutes to download and register.
au;1;App is fine. Remember to leave the first ‘0’ off your mobile phone number otherwise it will not work! Should have a note explaining that on the phone number screen
au;1;Not open sourced
au;5;Got no error while registering . So far so good .
au;3;Installed the app and verified phone number but maybe it should be more clear for users to enter their phone number without the first 0 because it has the country number +61 in front so start with 4 to enter your mobile number.
au;5;Not sure why everyone is having problems with registration, but I had no issues. Verification PIN came through immediately. Enter your number without the zero in front and without spaces
au;5;On the first try the app froze, most likely due to the high volume of people trying to activate it, but second time it worked like a charm!
au;5;Downloaded and installed, it is important you type your mobile number as +61 minus your zero. All set up and ready to protect my fellow Aussies!
au;5;Do not have the issue most are reporting. My mobile number registered 1st go no probs
au;5;Quick to install, no probs.
au;5;I don’t understand the reviews saying they couldn’t get past the verify telephone screen. Perhaps they were entering the leading “0” of their phone number when not required.
au;5;I think it’s good. They don’t request location services so they aren’t tracking your location to anyone who thinks the government is watching.
au;1;I am 62. I have an iPhone 4. The app will not work with the OS on my phone. Shaun Micallefe & Judith Lucy have the same phone. A vulnerable section of the population are being excluded.
au;5;Took me 30 seconds to set up! So easy - everyone should be getting on to this so we can go back to normal faster and help protect our most vulnerable
au;5;"Set up as intended. Register phone number etc 
Let’s show this Covid where to stick it"
au;5;"I initially read the reviews first before downloading and everyone was having trouble with the phone number..  drop the first #0 from your number and it works just fine.. very easy to set up.. 
stay safe everyone"
au;5;Registered without a hitch. Great idea.
au;5;Good initiative and expect all would register and help themself and others
au;5;The app works perfectly, people were just whinging about it not working because they were trying to log in before it officially opened
au;5;"Just installed this from the App Store on an iPhone 8. Registered info, verified phone number, no problems at all. Worked perfectly first time!

 If you have issues can I suggest trying again tomorrow. The more people have this app, the faster we’ll have this virus controlled and the easier we’ll be able to keep it under control!"
au;5;To respond to all the comments where people couldn’t register their mobile number, the accompanying Government release advised people to download and then register from 6pm AEST Sunday night. App registers seamlessly. Try again if you couldn’t register pre-6pm.
au;5;Signed and verified in about 90 seconds - just had to walk upstairs for phone signal to get the verification code.
au;5;"Brilliant, easy to install. 
Glad to do my bit to keep others, and myself, safe. 
The registration process was perfect, after 6pm as announced."
au;1;"Contact tracing is incredibly important, but in its current form this app is likely to be highly ineffective because of the privacy features of iOS

It sounds like it can only work if you don’t use any other app. Imagine visiting Woolworths and remembering to launch the app as you enter and not to launch any other app until you leave.

In relation to privacy, using the proper API will render the collection of every users name and number completely unnecessary.

I do like that it’s compatible with iOS 10, meaning it works with iPhones from 2012 and later. I hope this compatibly continues once the government acknowledge and embrace the API"
au;5;Easy to install. Didn’t have any issues verifying my mobile number. Drop the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number. Let’s hope this works at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and helping society get back to the new normal.
au;5;Anything that will Help keep people safe and help us return to normality I’m willing to do.
au;5;Extremely easy to register. Don’t enter 0 in the phone number.... hit a snag, find a solution, it’s not rocket science.
au;5;I just want to get my 100% salary back, so if this app helps then it’s what I need. Get me money and beers with my mates
au;5;I was able to register it without any problem. If installed by EVERYONE then this is a really good initiative and can be very much helpful in keeping us safe and aware about anyone covid-19 positive nearby .
au;5;Able to register fine now. Thank you!
au;5;On my phone and my husband’s phone, easy to use, no issues
au;1;"Due to restrictions iOS places on Bluetooth use, this app only works when it’s in the foreground and the user’s device is unlocked. The app does very little to tell users about this, and even if it did it’s unlikely users would be so disciplined in using it. 

Putting out an app that’s totally ineffective at contact tracing, while refusing to communicate these limitations to users is dangerously irresponsible. Giving users a sense of false confidence based on a broken app is only going to cause harm."
au;5;Registration worked fine for me, less than 30 second process.
au;5;All up and running under a minute 👍
au;5;For those who can’t get past the mobile number verification, just leave off the first zero of your number.
au;5;App was very quick and straight forward to setup and register. Those who had trouble with this may have been entering their mobile number beginning with zero?  The zero needs to be left off. Looking forward to seeing how effective this technology is.
au;5;Took my number just fine, no issues signing up at all.
au;5;when there is a +61 you must drop the 0 before entering your mobile number.
au;4;I don’t trust my data with this Minister but any tool that can be used should be used
au;5;You have to READ the policy FIRST and then registration will happen successfully.
au;5;Whatever I can do for the country I shall do it
au;3;People who are here temporarily or who have recently immigrated are not able to download the app at all. That’s millions of Australians.
au;5;"Really easy to sign up! 
Can’t wait to see how it all goes."
au;5;Easy to use. Read through everything. Seems like my data will be safe and not abused. If it helps with keeping us safe and the virus under control then so be it.
au;4;No problems so far, no issue with verifying my number.
au;5;I think this is a very good app but why do I need to verify the phone number can I just put the number in or out an email, a lot of kids don’t have a phone number so it stops them from getting the app it should just tell you in the app if you have come in close contact with someone with it, or make the phone number optional there are also a lot of people having issues with the phone number option so please remove the phone number or make it an in app notification or email.
au;5;Activated perfectly - everyone needs to install this
au;5;Set up went super smoothly for me (6pm 26/4). No issues whatsoever. I can only assume those experiencing issues may be due to high demand. Don’t stress, just try again a little later.
au;5;Took less than a minute to set up, no issues at all. Very happy😊
au;5;Downloaded and activated without a problem.
au;5;Downloaded and verified quickly.  Streamlined registration process
au;5;Try entering mobile number without the initial zero (ie +61 international mode)
au;5;If you tried earlier to setup it would not have worked, they said ready after 6pm.  All working well now.  Support Australia getting back to normal by installing this app.
au;5;"Phone registration now works.
Easy to register
Let’s see if that app does not drain too much battery and help in this fight against COVID-19"
au;5;Worked for me
au;5;eg the number 0455 555 555 should be entered as 455555555 (drop the zero)
au;5;Not sure what is the issue for those who can’t register.
au;5;No issues registering. There’s nothing wrong with the app.
au;5;Enter your mobile number without the ‘0’ at the beginning because the ‘+61’ area code is there
au;5;Took me 10s sign up and successfully received the verification code.
au;5;Easy to install and set up.
au;5;Mobile phone number worked for my wife and myself 👍
au;5;Work well on my phone, no problem register my number
au;5;Just don’t enter the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number.
au;5;Just downloaded the app and registered. Took less than 5 minutes. Lots of comments about phone numbers- leave the 0 off and no spaces.
au;5;For anyone having trouble registering try removing the “0” from the beginning of your phone number. It’s not needed with the +61 prefix
au;5;Worked fine for me.
au;5;"The app works fine. 
Just don’t put the 0 in from the front of your mobile number. 
61 0141 should be 61 141"
au;5;I’m not sure how people found this hard to set up... it was very quick and very easy to do.
au;5;Just what we need to beat the Chinese corona virus! 😀👍🏻
au;5;Found it easy to install, good information on what will be used to help Australia get through this together.
au;5;Installed and registered without a hitch. Verified phone number no problems on both my iPhones.
au;5;Took 30 seconds to register, simple to navigate with step by step process.
au;5;Installed and activated by sms seamlessly 👍
au;1;Why can you not use email to verify and communicate with use. Why is it only phone numbers?
au;5;stop complaining even i know how to get past verefying my phone number
au;5;No problems at all - Don’t know why so many people have had issues. All good here. Hopefully it gets smoothed out soon if it is a broader issue. Please be patient everyone.
au;5;Quick and easy to set up
au;5;I trust the Aus government with my data. For the benefit for all please download the app.
au;5;Quick n easy to setup within a minute and quickly verified my number as well. Hope it will be effective too. Nice work Gov 👍
au;5;I didn’t have any problem registering. I have an iPhone 7 Plus. iOS 13.3.1
au;5;Very straightforward to register. Sensible permissions and privacy steps. Confirmation by SMS instantaneous. I think other reviewers must have been overly impatient to write off an app within a few minutes of the 6pm (according to SMH) launch.
au;5;Sign up was fast and easy, done within a minute. No dramas with phone number input.
au;5;Really happy to do my bit to help reduce communal transmission of this awful virus. Let’s join together to prevent a second wave that could be worse than what we have seen. Look at Singapore ..
au;5;Think they must’ve fixed the bugs as took me about 60 seconds to complete sign up
au;5;Works well
au;5;My mobile number worked fine and I’m registered now
au;5;Registration worked alright here.
au;5;Easy setup. No issues with mobile verification. Support the cause.
au;5;Thank you Australian Government. Done and super easy.
au;5;"I hope everyone takes the right approach and downloads this app so we can reopen our communities sooner and deal with any cases efficiently should more occur. 

Contrary to boomer belief this app does not track your location or use GPS. Do not believe the fear mongers who say otherwise.

Every precaution has been taken"
au;5;Done and dusted, was more nervous putting my details into my Pornhub account when I was setting that up 👍🏻
au;5;Great initiative to help keep us safe. Easy registration. Took 30 seconds.
au;1;could not register
au;5;Just downloaded and installed the app, not issues at all. Clean easy to understand design.
au;5;No problem with registration , all completed within a few minutes.
au;5;Working beautifully. Haven’t got Covid.
au;5;Very easy to download
au;5;I'm glad the government finally made this app, very easy to install and use. we can beat this coronavirus if we can work together.
au;5;Faster this lockdown/isolation is over
au;5;I just downloaded the app and the process was very easy I didn’t get the ‘cannot verify your phone’ error everyone else is talking about. It took me 3 min to set up, user friendly.
au;5;Very easy to use and set up.
au;5;Installed and is working fine.
au;4;Worked straight away - you need to drop the leading 0 of your mobile number.
au;5;It will be useful if more people install it
au;4;Actively looked for the app wanting to download it and couldn’t find it anywhere. Had to go to a news article to find it
au;5;App works fine. I’ve I saw numerous reviews saying it won’t accept phone number. Where you see a +61 prefix you don’t enter the first 0 of your mobile number just the remaining 9 digits.
au;5;"Well done team aus gov. Special 👏🏻 to the brains behind this app and tech. Definitely can be improved from
Bt technology to other means, but so far excellent initiative. Would recommend everyone to start using this app. I think this is a sacrifice we need to make to keep everyone safe including each you.."
au;5;Very easy set up. Less than 30 seconds from start to finish.
au;4;Easy enough to setup
au;5;Downloaded the app and registered no problems at all
au;5;Easy to use. Will do anything to support Aus.
au;5;No problem with download, installation and verification on iPhone.
au;4;When entering your mobile start with 4 not the 0, it has started your number +61 so you start with +61 4********. I registered in 30sec
au;4;"Registered mobile fine (without leading 0). 
Says leave the app running - unclear whether this means with phone on, screen off, or running in background. Video instructions would be sensible!"
au;5;"Less than a minute to set up- set and forget is the best way.

Most of you negative review - you applied to early, it up and running now"
au;5;Phone number verified for me no problems
au;5;No issues verifying phone number now. 👍🏻
au;5;My parter and I had no issue with registering. When you get to the mobile number bit +61 is already there, so when putting your mobile number in don’t do 04 just do 4 and the rest of your number. +61 replaces the 0 in the 04 beginning of a mobile number. Hope that makes sense and helps.
au;5;Installed without any issue.
au;5;I saw a comment that the app wouldn’t register at the phone number stage. I had the same problem but resolved it by turning off my VPN for registration. That allowed registration to happen and once I completed that, I turned the VPN back on. Hope this helps 👍🏼
au;4;Super easy to download and register. Working perfect.
au;5;You don’t need to enter the zero at the start of your mobile number
au;5;Easy to use and a quick process. People seem to forget that you cannot register before 6pm. Shame for the negative reviews. I hope it doesn’t push people away given people were too eager and tried to register before 6pm. Please download this app!
au;5;"Seen all the comments about unable to verify but no issue here. 

Looks simple enough. 

If it helps it’s worth doing!"
au;5;App is now working and easy to register
au;5;Best defence we have to respond to virus spread .
au;5;"Do you care about others?
Prove it, download and start supporting our community"
au;5;I was able to download and register my mobile.  Worked ok, saysit working and  I’m safe.
au;5;Don’t know what the others are on about easy to register. +61 is there use remove the 0 from your mobile number and enter from the 4 onwards
au;4;For mobiles drop the 0 and type in “+614.......”
au;5;Worked perfectly
au;5;Super easy sign up and great method of tracking
au;5;Thank you for creating this app to keep us safe during these times! People are saying they can’t get past the phone number step, but I did.
au;5;Phone number works fine. I did not include the leading zero.
au;5;Very simple to register
au;5;Don’t know if people having problems know to drop the 0 off their numbers or if was genuinely not working previously. But downloaded and registered my phone number immediately just now. Stay safe everyone. Stay home and stop the spread. Protect yourselves and help protect those of us who work in the country’s hospitals. ❤️
au;4;Mobile phone number setup no issues, not sure what others are on about!
au;5;Unlike some of the reviewers on here, it was super easy to download the app, register and verify my mobile number.
au;5;No issues with verification very easy to download
au;1;Got stuck at Bluetooth and there was no information on how to resolve it. Deleted it off my phone
au;5;That was easy
au;5;It’s really good
au;5;Took less that 2 minutes to install on both household mobile phones. Very easy and notifications seem to work fine when Bluetooth is turned off (I tested it out)
au;5;Downloaded straight away on first day but couldn’t register phone number. Came back after 6pm (when they said it would be active) and it worked
au;5;"Help 

Won’t accept my valid mobile number

Update 

Seems like it is fixed - Installed no probs"
au;5;Took 2 mins to get it set up.
au;5;Was really straight forward to sign up and quick to verify.
au;5;Downloaded the app easily. I hope people that are having downloading issues remember to drop the zero at the start of their phone number.
au;2;At upload consent it says I am COVID19 positive. Not sure why does that mean?
au;5;Amazing application
au;5;I'm an app developer (I had nothing to do with this app though). We should ALL download & enable this. Privacy-wise, they've taken the right approach. It'll still be useful even without a massive install base. If it notifies even one person who interacts with vulnerable people that they need to get tested, it will have been worthwhile. It only asks for details that are already publicly available on the electoral roll plus your phone number. Worked perfectly for me.
au;5;Took 2 minutes to register. Was a breeze.
au;5;Not sure if fixed but works for me!
au;5;No issues downloading.
au;5;No troubles setting it up.
au;5;So if you have tried to download before then it won’t work. Operator error not app or government error. Try again it was easy. Stay safe
au;5;Hearing lots of ‘it doesn’t work’ but the announcement was it won’t be active until 6pm. Now active and seems to be accepting the phone number registration
au;5;Downloading App was v straightforward. No glitch recognising my phone number. Privacy policy reassuring. Looks good so far.
au;5;Easy to register. Now let’s eliminate this virus together!
au;5;No problem downloading to iPhone!!  If I am exposed to Covid19 I want to know ASAP so I can be tested and treated.
au;5;Entered phone number no problems works great no issues takes less than 1 minute
au;5;"Very easy to install and verify. But people who use the 0 of their mobile number will have problems because the programmer has put the +61 there and a lot of people do not understand what +61 means.
It may have been easy for all to install i an verify if everyone simply put their number in including the 0. 
Always use the KISS principle. Keep It Simple   Stupid.
Good work to our leadership"
au;1;I want to use this app but I can’t be sent the code to verify my phone number
au;5;Simple design, seems pretty solid!
au;4;"Took me less than thirty seconds to install and start..  don’t know what all the ‘invalid number’ comments are about. 

Took the housemate about 40 seconds to complete - this is not hard.."
au;1;More broken promises ... also this app doesn’t use the APIs being delivered by Apple and Google, so for Bluetooth to work you have to have the app running and in the foreground? How useful is that ...
au;5;Took 30secs to sign up! No problems with phone number at all! Easy!
au;5;No problem with registering my phone number.  Was easy and simple to register.
au;3;Works... start your number from 4
au;5;Easy Peasy.  Took less than a minute.
au;5;Worked fine for me. Doing my bit 👍🏻
au;4;A lot has changed in four hours it seems. Registration worked fine and it is set up. Straightforward and hoping I never get an alert!
au;5;Apple phone, Registered 30mins after app available (1830hrs) , no problems. 😊
au;5;Download this and make a difference Australia
au;5;Downloaded the app & registered with no issues. People complaining about not being able to pass the phone number section, no issues here. Removed the 0 from my mobile number and away we go.
au;5;I think people are making the mistake when entering their mobile number of putting the full number in. Take your first digit off as the +61 replaces it. Common sense really
au;5;Worked fine for me. I did not enter a zero at the start of my mobile number.
au;5;Works well
au;5;Download today. Easy. Simple. Works.
au;5;For those that had errors, potentially was before the govt switched in registrations. Try again. Worked first go on both of our iPhones.
au;4;No problems with setting up the app. But the instruction to keep the app running when you’re out is ambiguous. Does that mean the app has to be open, or can it run in the background while I’m using another app?
au;4;Had no issues verifying my mobile number in the first go. Downloaded and signed up with ing 10 minutes of release.
au;5;No problems installing app on an iPhone. Hope it makes a difference
au;5;Great app, good to know it’s helping keeping you safe
au;5;Downloaded and logged on after 6pm, super easy and very reassuring. If we want to get back to anything like “normal” everyone must download the app and use it!
au;5;Simplest app to install with clear instructions.
au;5;Worked perfectly if you followed the instructions in the press release and waited until 6pm to register (which clearly many didn’t!).
au;5;Straightforward. No issues verifying my mobile number. Not sure what the complaints were about. Glad to be doing this for the greater good of our society.
au;5;Downloaded and set up in 2min
au;4;All the bad reviews didn’t read the information that you couldn’t register until after 6pm. If you waited there was no problem. Anyway good on them for trying to get in early
au;3;Enter the phone number without 0 and without any spaces, should work
au;5;The “could not register” reviews were done prior to the 6pm release time.
au;5;"Quick and easy to download.
Thank you Australia for keeping us all safe"
au;5;"Those saying they can’t get their number recognised, have you tried leaving off the leading zero? Because the app has the +61 at the front this usually means you enter your phone number without the leading zero. I imagine they’ve put the 61 there to ensure that only Australian numbers can participate, which is sensible. I left off the leading zero and got in straight away with no issues at all. 

I think this app is a great initiative. I’m not worried about the so called problems of authorities knowing where I am. They can already do that anyway through the phone’s location service and through the gps on my car. This is designed for better tracing of who you happen to be around in the shops or at work or wherever, to meet the response to the virus, so I’ll support it."
au;4;Never receive PIN
au;4;"No issues with verification or registration, which a lot of other people seemed to have problems with. 

Will be interesting to see what happens now"
au;5;Remember to not put the 0 at the front of your number.. so drop the 0 and then you will register fine.
au;1;Obviously overseas folk are not a threat...
au;5;"Installed quick and easily. Records minimal information. You give more personal information completing a tax return. 
Happy to get on board to help stop the spread of COVID and get back to normal"
au;5;Doing my bit to help keep Australia protected from this horrible virus.
au;5;Seamless and activated without any problems
au;5;Within 10 seconds I was up and running with no issues.
au;5;For a first version 1.00 government app, works smoothly and I didn’t had problems in logging my data into it. I gave it 5 star, but we’ll see if it’s worth that much.
au;3;No probs signing up but a black screen keeps flashing up.
au;5;👍👍
au;3;"It’s a pity the Government didn’t make a release saying the app wouldn’t work before 6.00 pm. 
However it’s working now and the good thing is that a lot of people are trying to use it. Hopefully it will get a large take up and assist us in getting back to normal 
Boba"
au;5;It took my phone number. No issues. All good for us Aussies. 🇦🇺
au;5;No problems when registering.
au;5;"Not sure if I did anything different but it worked straight away. Don’t put the first zero of your number. 
Will see about battery life."
au;5;Works fine, I’m not sure what problem everyone has
au;5;No issues in setup
au;5;Installed and set up within 5 mins.
au;5;It works fine. You need to put your mobile phone in correctly people. It picks up as a international number +61 & leave the 0 off your mobile number & it will work fine.
au;5;It’s my first app review. Smooth installation and hope it will protect Australian people.
au;3;Easy to sign up after 6pm AEST tonight. Not able to verify phone number earlier, but super easy once app was switched on after 6pm. Not sure at this stage how much app will drain battery.
au;5;Only too me 1 minute to load and register.  Will see how effective the App is.
au;5;Ignore the 1 star reviews from people who don’t know how to read. The govt released the app today at 3pm, and go-live for registration was at 6pm. Reviewers saying the app is broken simply didn’t wait for the correct launch time, as notified via the media. Pretty sad indictment of our society!
au;5;App must be fixed as it worked for me
au;5;"Since they have included the +61, you don’t have to enter the first 0 of your mobile phone.

So if your phone number is 041234567. It’s actually +61 41234567. So enter 41234567 and you will get the SMS to verify."
au;5;To everyone saying that they can’t verify their phone number - remember to drop the 0 when entering your number eg if your number is 0567 then only enter 567 ✅
au;5;It uses the international number, drop the 0 at the front and mine worked first go.
au;5;No issues at all. Easy.
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number which I’ve had for 30 years ..?
au;5;Keep safe!
au;4;This is for those that have had trouble verifying their phone number.... drop the leading 0, it use international code (+61) so I think the 0 isn’t necessary. I did it and had no trouble.
au;5;Easy to set up, register and use. Simple and intuitive. Won’t need it I am keeping away from everyone...!
au;4;When entering the phone number, don’t start with ‘0’, start with 4XXX
au;5;Phone number was not registering but then I realised that was because you couldn’t sign up till 6pm AEST. Was fine after
au;5;"Quick and easy to download and install.
Lets all crack on and get this done for the greater good. 👍🏼"
au;5;Put on two iphones with no problems
au;1;I too can’t get past the phone number request. Been trying for hours including deleting and reloading
au;5;I suspect thousands trying to get in quickly to set App up. All good now. Simple to use. Hopefully this is a sign of our community wanting to participate in this.
au;5;"It would make sense to advise people that when they enter a phone number with +61 at the beginning, you DO NOT enter the “0” at the beginning of your phone number.
We may think that everybody should know this but there are many people who do not travel or make overseas phone calls so they may not be aware of international dialling protocols."
au;5;Worked perfectly for me. Enter your mobile without the 0. Here’s hoping enough people use this so we can come out of the house and get back to normal life.
au;1;Wow this app took down my battery from 100 to 30 in just 20min..
au;5;Took me less than 2 mins to read and sign up...
au;5;Very simple to set up and verify consent.
au;5;Very easy registration process. If it helps save one life - I’m in.
au;5;Registration was quick and I had no trouble entering my mobile number like others have been reporting.
au;5;App launched at 6pm. Try now
au;5;"The app is up and running. Super easy to register through your mobile number and doesn’t ask for much information. 
Seems like everyone who downloaded the app early didn’t listen to the government who said you could register from 6pm."
au;5;Thanks for setting this up!!!
au;5;Not sure what others are talking about but I was able to set the app and register within few seconds. Pretty straight forward app. Would be good to see more features add up in the future.
au;5;Quick to down load. Mechanics worked fine.
au;4;Makes me feel safer already 👏🏼
au;5;Easy to use worked fine no problems at all
au;5;Not sure why there is lot of bad reviews. Worked perfectly first time and no issues whatsoever. Thank you for doing this amazing app to help the stress of an outbreak to notify anyone who may need to get tested.
au;5;No problem at all with registering - I'm probably stating the obvious here (no doubt) but for people experiencing issues registering phone number please ensure you remove the 0 from the mobile number!
au;5;"No problems registering at all. 

Very straightforward"
au;5;I can’t believe the negative reviews with setting up on this app. It took me less than a minute to set my mobile number and verify. So so simple!!!
au;5;I loaded this app in a few minutes. I read the previous review who couldn’t get past the phone number page. As the number is entered in international format you just need to drop the “0” at the beginning of your number. I hope this can keep the nation safe
au;5;No problem for me. I think the other users signed up before registration was released at 6AEST
au;5;Early error message cleared and downloaded fine. Great idea. Here’s hoping enough start using it.
au;5;Do the right thing Australia and download this app so that everyone can be safe and restrictions lifted.
au;5;You’ve probably spent half your life on Facebook being data mined - stop worrying about nonexistent privacy issues and download it.
au;5;I had no problems registering at all..
au;5;Very simple and easy to download. Completed in less than 5 minutes
au;5;Took less than 30 seconds to set up. Phone verification now working. The more people that download the quicker we can return to something resembling normality.
au;5;Too easy...
au;5;I had no problems whatsoever . I’m using the iPhone XR.
au;5;Don’t input the first “0” while registering your phone number, use last 9 digits only.
au;5;No issues adding my phone number
au;5;If I download the app on my iPad, does it need to be near my phone to work.
au;5;Downloaded the app and registered without a problem.
au;5;Let’s help track COVID.
au;3;"A lot of people seem to be having an issue with registering. 
I’ve downloaded the app, added phone no. etc with no issues. 
Check the app again guys. I’d say problem has been fixed."
au;1;Tried many times and will not recognize my phone number.
au;5;A lot of negative reviews about the mobile number not working, but it needs to be entered WITHOUT the 0 in front of the 4. The mobile you enter needs to be 9 digits long, not 10. A suggestion for the developers is to remove the leading 0 if people enter it by mistake.
au;5;No problems with phone registration. Just be sure to enter the number WITHOUT the initial “0”. You’ll see +61......., and just need to enter your number starting with the first 4. Go Australia!
au;5;Read the reviews and thought I’d give it a go... no problem at all verifying phone number.
au;5;"This app collects absolute minimal information about you. It doesn’t track where you’ve been, just who you’ve been near. If you’ve been near someone for 15 minutes who tests positive to the virus, you get a phone call. Simple.
Ignore those reviews saying that they couldn’t verify their phone number. As mentioned in the press conference you couldn’t register until 6am. App works flawlessly."
au;3;Phone number works if you drop the zero off the front
au;5;Works fine. Registered fine.
au;5;It was an easy set up and now it’s running. Good stuff
au;5;Not sure if its a date thing or a network thing but my app verified immediately with no errors on Sunday 26th April. Optus network. Easy
au;5;No issues. Took 15 seconds. Do it and we can go back to work sooner. Go Aussie!
au;5;When u put your phone number in you do not need the first 0 of your mobile number 🤞
au;5;This is OUR ONE CHANCE to use technology to fight the virus and get our life back.
au;1;I’m getting an error after entering in my mobile number and trying to get the code also.
au;4;Managed to register with no issues. Looking forward to seeing if this lets us resume a somewhat normal life during this pandemic
au;5;Look great to me.  Easy to download. No issues. Very easy. Download and stay alive
au;5;I had no problems installing - hopefully the issues have been rectified for everyone
au;5;Worked fine. Let’s see how this helps out going forward...
au;5;Literally a potential life saver
au;5;After reading all the negative reviews I was a bit hesitant,install and register all worked very easy for me.👍
au;5;No problem signing up.  Glad that this will help contain outbreaks.
au;1;PIN failing and unable to request new onw
au;5;Great initiative. Easy and problem free install.
au;1;Please fix this.
au;5;Very simple to use as there’s not much data to input. Verification worked immediately.
au;5;No problem registering. iPhone 11 Pro, I didn’t use the 0 before my phone number.
au;5;Took about 90 seconds to set. Great peace of mind
au;5;Didnt encounter any issue, could be the lucky ones.
au;5;It was great I had no problem
au;5;Had no issues registering...got a text code within seconds...didn’t use a ‘0’ in front of number.
au;5;Seems to work well, despite what the conspiracy theorists say lol.
au;5;Not sure what everyone is complaining about. App works fine and registration is seamless. Such an important app to have right now.
au;5;"Was a simple process and worked seemlessly!
Others unable to load have all tried at once - need to try again tomorrow."
au;5;Easy to setup, got my verification code once I entered my phone number and together we can beat this beast...
au;5;Didn’t have an issue with the phone number. Just drop the zero and all good.
au;4;"Registered straight away with no problem.
Remember to drop the Zero on your mobile number as they have added + 61 already."
au;5;"Simple to use. Doesn’t ask for much information - plenty of apps and sites would have more on me than this does!
Do it people"
au;5;Because the phone number you enter is prefixed with +61, you need to drop the first “0” of your mobile number when entering it
au;5;Spread the word and save lives and livelihoods!
au;5;Easy to install, saw a few reviews saying they can’t proceed past the mobile number rego....it’s got the +61 Australian country code, so you don’t need to use the first 0 of your mobile number.....
au;5;And was seamless!
au;1;I try with an 0 and without. Still says there is an error....
au;5;No problems to download and register, everyone should download it, I want to keep safe
au;5;Doesn't appear to do much yet, registration went well and no issues.
au;1;"Tried several times! Same message comes up😔
Taxpayers $, Ruby v1.2"
au;5;Easy to work through. Entered mobile number without the 0 and verifying text sent. Bluetooth on. App active. Smash the curve!
au;5;Downloaded app & found it pretty straight forward to use.
au;5;Downloaded and verified OK. App was easy to setup and looks like it’ll sit in the background and do its thing.
au;5;Accepts my phone number. The media said it wouldn’t work before 6pm on the day it was released, so I just waited until then to download.
au;5;"Quick and easy. 
Works as described."
au;5;Signed on fine no problems at all
au;5;Installed and registered in less than 2 minutes
au;4;Leave the zero off the start of mobile numbers. As it’s a +61, you have to drop the zero, then it works.
au;5;No issues
au;5;Setup without a problem. Time will tell whether it keeps running on an iPhone without frequent intervention. Also, with regard to some low ratings, I suspect servers might be overloaded for the SMS verification and that’s why some people are having an issue. Just wait a day or two.
au;4;Try dropping the zero from your mobile number if having issues. . .
au;5;Used my mobile number without the 0 (due to country code being added by default) and it worked first go.
au;5;The app doesn’t track your location like everyone was worried. Much ado about nothing.
au;5;It set up without a hitch
au;5;Simple and easy to use, great initiative by the health department
au;1;Can’t use if number cannot be verified
au;5;Kind of buggy
au;4;"I found the app easy to register and read the privacy statement easily. I am curious to know how my battery use will be impacted by having Bluetooth on all the time, but we’ll see. I have a feeling all it will record is continual contacts with my husband. 
Good luck everyone and we’ll done app developers and designers."
au;5;I had success verifying my mobile number. First time I used a nickname and it failed. When I used my real name it worked. May have to match the name on your phone account?
au;5;Completed in about 2 min after reading information.  No problem with verifying my mobile number.  Remember to drop the first 0 when entering your number!  Let’s hope it works.
au;4;"It should be made clear to users during signup that +61 substitutes the leading 0 from an Australian mobile number.

This simple clear direction will ensure that all those hundreds of people claiming the app is broken can verify their mobile number successfully and help to support the goals of the app."
au;4;If you didn’t know the name of the app and you searched for the term “covid app Australia” then you get a different app. Because this other app is from government I can see where a lot of people will download it and think they are done.
au;1;Gets stuck and cannot Verify mobile
au;5;Literally took 1 minute. No issues at all.
au;2;App does not recognise my phone number. I did my husband’s phone for him and there was no problem.This needs to be fixed urgently as many potential participators will be lost.
au;4;Just downloaded the app without any problems. Perhaps people who reported a problem didn’t follow the instructions closely which require you to turn your Bluetooth on BEFORE the last step.
au;5;Earlier while entering valid phone number and it was giving error. It’s now been fixed and working.
au;5;It took me 2 mins to set up with no hassles at all.
au;5;Done in a minute
au;5;"No dramas registering with my iPhone. There’s also a great technical analysis on Twitter if you want to know the internal workings of the app. Sounds pretty similar to the papers released by Google and Apple on how they will natively allow support States/Govs to do contact tracing.

Doing my part to stop the spread of COVID-19."
au;5;"Be part of the solution
Worked perfectly and smoothly no problems"
au;4;As in the title
au;5;"Lots of negative reviews about a phone verification bug...
I had no issues when signing up myself so it has likely been fixed. Otherwise please be patient and keep trying over the next few days; everyone is trying their best and I’m sure it’ll be fixed soon if not already. It’s important not to dissuade people from downloading :)"
au;5;Easy to install. It require your name and mobile number. Total 1 minutes
au;5;Registrations opening from 6pm, comments from before this time should be disregarded, get on board Australia!
au;5;Registration opened at 6pm AEST. That’s why it didn’t work before 6pm for many people.
au;5;"Just turn of Wifi when putting your number in.
So it can handshake properly.
As when on wifi it can’t see your number.
Easy install no problems just have it on 4g"
au;5;Easy as to install even on a really old iPhone. Took all of 1 minute. Everyone should get it.
au;1;Not working, error when verifying phone number
au;5;Had no problems signing up. Just drop the 0 from your mobile number
au;1;Phone number not recognised. Gave up after multiple attempts.
au;5;Super simple to set up.  No problems. Quick & easy!
au;5;Lots of negative reviews submitted here but i gave a try and its working fine. Registered in a first go without any hassle. Thanks to Health department for taking initiative steps.
au;5;Works perfectly and only a small app. If you are unsure about it- think of the health workers that you might just save by downloading this...
au;4;The app worked fine for me?   Maybe the servers were overloaded earlier?
au;5;Everyone get this app to stop the spread and we can get out of quarantine quicker
au;5;"So easy. Just follow the links. 30sec setup- max.

I’m using an iPhone 8 . Version 13.3.1 (I think)."
au;4;You don’t need I use the 0 at the start of your mobile number.
au;4;Follow the step by step prompts for easy upload - turn on Bluetooth
au;5;No problem to register. Everything worked as it should!
au;5;There is no problem connecting to the mobile phone number(IPhone users ,with 0)
au;5;Very easy and straightforward way to protect each other. Took 60 seconds to set up
au;5;Easy to register. No problems.
au;1;Can’t get past “error verifying phone number”..
au;5;No issues with registration.  Great concept, privacy protected with no overreach.
au;2;Although it was a charge of $0.00, I don’t understand why my bank account had to be pinged . Other free apps you download without the app testing your account details. Makes me suspicious and I don’t want to be.
au;5;"It was a really smooth installation and lots of explanations of everything.

Hope it helps in this battle."
au;5;"I see a lot of complaints, I didn’t have a problem. I did automatically omit zero when entering my mobile number because it was in international format +61 4___________.
I am not sure if that is the issue that people have been having."
au;5;61 4xxxxxxxx
au;5;So easy to set up!!! Terrific stuff-thank you!
au;5;Had no trouble verifying my number. Also added my work mobile and all went smoothly. Well designed app, good amount of information without being bureaucratic. Simple but effective way to help lift restrictions and keep us all safe.
au;3;Remember if entering your phone number, do not add the (0) after the +61 then 43******* etc. not 043. You may find that it will work then.
au;5;"App works fine. Very straight forward.
Very easy to help those more vulnerable."
au;5;"Downloaded app at 8:30pm 26/04. 
No dramas at all took 3 mins total. 
My understanding (could be wrong) is the app was available  but registration wasn’t till after 6pm.

Best wishes to stay safe!"
au;5;Easy sign up, went smoothly.
au;5;Despite some reviews saying otherwise, there were no errors setting it up.
au;5;Easy to download. Hope it’s effective .
au;5;Works fine. This is a wonderful idea.
au;5;No problems encountered at all...easy process
au;3;For those who are saying it’s not working the problem is you. Enter your mobile number with the leading zero left off. The +61 takes the place of the first digit of your phone number. Basic stuff people..
au;5;"Downloaded and installed fine. Registration was straight forward and worked without issue. 

Some other reviews suggest not being able to register their mobile numbers. I think this may be because they are not dropping 0 off the front of their number as is the standard when using the international dial code +61"
au;5;Was able to register in less than 3 minutes
au;5;Great to see an easy to use and highly relevant app launched by the govt. in a timely manner.  For those with privacy concerns: you can choose to download or not but if not then one would hope you stay isolated and keep others safe. Australia has a good record in regard to respecting its citizens privacy.
au;5;Installed easily- did not face the problem of the phone number verification. It took about a minute to get the verification code though.
au;5;Can’t understand the negative feedback, I had no problems following the instructions and registering
au;5;Signed up with no issues 👍
au;5;"The app installed like a breeze. 
Let’s all work together and save lives."
au;5;I can smell the ISO freedom already.
au;3;As far as I can work out you cannot enter other mobile numbers to ignore as we have three phones and when they are in charging station overnight they all will constantly be recording and storing useless information
au;5;Let’s do our best to stay on top of this thing!
au;5;App works fine. Added my mobile phone number without the 0, my wife added the 0. It worked both ways. Got the text and entered the confirmation code. Accepted all questions. Up and running.
au;5;Easy to use and download.
au;5;"Very simple to install. 
Make sure no full stops or anything when adding your name and it will then recognise phone number."
au;5;To all those people having difficulties in entering your mobile number, it only wants a nine digit number so drop the zero at the beginning
au;5;If you don’t get this app or you have been near someone who won’t then don’t come near me thanks👍
au;1;Can’t be install great app NOT
au;5;Very easy to download, fantastic initiative. I suspect the phone number problems are user error
au;3;Signed up with no problems at all
au;5;When entering your mobile number you have to only enter the numbers after the 0. Don’t not enter the 0 just the last 9 numbers
au;4;"Very easy to set up - asks for minimal information, just first name and number. Only problem is I nearly uploaded my information at the bottom where it asks ‘has a health professional asked you to upload your information?’ I think that’s just for confirmed cases???!

Not worried at all about scaremongering of the government having my info - I have a Medicare card, bank accounts, a passport, licence etc - pretty sure I have enough for them to track me if they could be bothered! and if privacy is really a concern to you - why are you people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, PayPal, eBay, etc etc etc.... they have more than enough on you if they want! 

Do it - look after each other Australia - let’s not be like Europe or the USA and lose so many lives."
au;5;Drop the zero at the start of your number: +61 4????????
au;5;Don’t input the 0 at the beginning of your phone number and it will a register just fine.
au;5;This is a brilliant way to stay safe and cut the risk of spreading this dreadful pandemic
au;4;Installed and registered no problem. So maybe it’s fixed now.
au;5;To all those people who can’t understand how to enter a phone number properly then listen and learn. +61 is our region code. So all you have to do is drop the 0 from your number and enter it in. Eg. your phone number is 0412 345 678. In the app it would be +61 412 345 678.
au;5;5 stars to offset against the users below who tried to register before launch and therefore failed.
au;1;Can’t even set the thing up.
au;5;Quick and easy setup. No issues with number verification
au;4;The registration was easy. I am happy to sign up to help reduce the spread.
au;5;A great health app! Get it now and help keep Australia covid free.
au;5;"Can register fine

I dropped the first zero from the mobile number."
au;5;Note when entering your phone number you you need to leave the first zero off. No problems registering if you do this.
au;5;Registration worked fine.
au;5;Thank you mr. Morrison for keeping us safe!!
au;4;"People
Have had problems registering mobile numbers for some reason but I had no issues. 👍"
au;5;Had no problems entering my details. Nice app.
au;5;In the interest of getting people to use the app, I am reviewing to say it worked for me. I saw lots of people saying it didn’t work - it worked for me, so perhaps they’ve fixed it. Give it a go, I was able to put my number in and register without a problem. Left the 0 out.
au;5;No idea what is wrong with the other people leaving reviews. Are they entering their phone number incorrectly? Worked perfectly for me straight away.
au;5;No problem registering the first time. Got my pin within seconds.
au;4;I didn’t run into registration issues. Hope more people get on board
au;5;Super easy to Download install - took less than a minute!
au;5;No issues registering here. Let’s see how we go!
au;5;Despite the negative press, I’m happy to install the app as I am out and about seeing clients, so anything I can do to help myself and clients I’ll do.
au;4;No problems installing. Remember to drop the first zero from your mobile number when verifying, the pin came through in < 1 second
au;5;It works perfectly no issue with number
au;1;Tried multiple times to complete signing up, but keeps coming up error after I put in my mobile number...
au;5;No trouble installing and everything is clearly explained
au;5;Simple. Took 30 seconds
au;5;I registered after 6pm once the server was online and my mobile number was accepted.
au;5;Took less than a minute to sign up. Very user friendly. Not having the issue that some others have mentioned
au;5;"Simple app to install and activate. Those having issues should not include the 0 in front of their mobile numbers, because when the country code is already included, you drop the first zero in the number.

App developer should automatically check for the zero and drop it for the users."
au;5;"As was announced the app allows you to register after 6pm today.  Very quick and easy to install and register.  

No issues to report from me. Thank you Aus government for doing all you can to keep us safe."
au;5;"All those people giving this app 1 star as they were not able to complete their registration - i.e. could not enter their phone number, tried to register too early. They did not bother to actually read or listen to any information when the app was launched.
Negative reviews written early on the 26/4/2020 referencing contact number issues should simply be IGNORED."
au;5;Get me back a more normal life sooner? Sign me up! Was easy to register and activate, and clear instructions on how to use.
au;5;I presume the app will do what it says and only time will tell if the data is as secure as they say. Very easy to install. Suspect the large number of 1 Star reviews are from ignorant people who put potential privacy above the health of the community.
au;1;Given no time to set verification number-..2nd attempt failed also 😡
au;5;Works fine, easy to register. Everyone who is saying it didn’t work it was because it wasn’t going “live” to enter your mobile number until 6pm EST.
au;5;Easy to install. Great concept.
au;1;Was only a matter of time really. We will just sit here and swallow it then ask for more. The sheeple have spoken
au;5;Everyone reporting they couldn’t register their mobile didn’t read that they had to wait until 6pm to register. It works fine. P.S. always keep the app open in the background.
au;5;"Why are so many of you complaining about the app not taking your mobile number and giving this 1 star? Yes it happened to me also 3 hours ago, but I knew that of course they will get it sorted out. 

Take a breath, and look at what this app is going to be doing. 

This app will help us get back to a closer normal sooner. So let’s all look on the bright side of this situation. We are not in the same boat - but we are in the same storm. I’m in the “optimistic” boat. Who’s with me?"
au;5;Quick and easy to register. Worked first time.
au;5;Installs, registers and appears to work as it is meant to. No issues so far.
au;5;Needs to written out without spacing and if that doesn’t work, try without the ‘0’
au;1;App won’t accept my mobile number. Have reinstalled multiple times - very frustrating.
au;5;Easy to install and setup. Mobile phone number issue has not been activated, so it works well!
au;5;Great idea, hope the issues others are facing have been quickly fixed. It worked for me straight away.
au;5;The Australian International Dialing Code +61 is part of the mobile phone number registration, therefore, don’t include the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number, that is the reason why so many of you are having registration issues.
au;5;Just downloaded and registered, no issues (yet). Make sure you don’t include zero at start of your mobile number for verification.
au;5;Those with unfounded complaints about privacy need to seriously reconsider their priorities.
au;5;Had no problem activating with my phone number. Make sure you omit the 0 at the start of the number.
au;5;Worked well- easy to set up. Joining the COVID fight 💪🏼🦠
au;5;Perfect install. No troubles
au;5;Set this up in a few minutes. Had no trouble with registering phone number. Hope this technology helps keep the numbers down.
au;5;The app launched at 6pm but was available on the App Store earlier than that. If you couldn’t verify your mobile number probably you were trying before the 6pm start time. Try again now.
au;5;Simple, fast, easy 😊
au;5;Easy to install, no issues entering phone number, just knock the 0 off your number before entering.
au;5;Logged in and working. Let’s see what happens next. I have given more personal details to business around the world that I trust a lot less than the Australian government.
au;5;Easy to download and register
au;4;Quick and easy to download. Had an error message on first try but came back 10 minutes later and it was fixed.
au;5;"Easy to use took me 20 seconds to register. Wasn’t hard at all. 
PS don’t put the 0 at the start of your mobile number."
au;4;It’s working for me 26/4/20 20:50AEST Apple IPhone 6
au;5;I’ve seen a lot of comments about being unable to register. The issue appears to be fixed.
au;5;There was a clear instruction not to register your phone number til after 6pm so pretty much every review can be disregarded and it’s working fine.
au;5;So far so good !
au;5;Worked first go. No issues verifying my phone number.
au;5;Hopefully it helps us all stay safe. Strong privacy protection. Everyone should install it ASAP.
au;5;Several people have said app not verifying phone number. Asking for +61 number. Leave out the zero at beginning of mobile number and enter remaining digits. Firstly came up with error message and then was immediately sent verification PIN number. Once I entered and verified pin it confirmed registration success!
au;5;Download this so we can get our freedom back
au;4;Very difficult to locate in the App Store if you don’t know the exact name.
au;5;"Nil issues with registration. 
Let’s do the right thing and get back to normal life again soon."
au;4;"Mobile verification seems to be working for me. When prompted for the number I left out the ‘0’ at the beginning of my number. 

Though I did experience the ‘COVID-19’ splash screen keep popping up and going away during my registration process. Seems to be only at the registration process so it was all good afterwards."
au;5;"Really simple to register, clear interface. 

Heard some people tried to register before 6pm on the day of launch, even though it was announced it would only work from then. Assume that’s why there are some 1-star ratings, but all working now."
au;5;Some reviews mentioned problems with registration, but I am using ios and I didn’t have any problems.
au;5;Looks good !
au;5;"Downloaded, installed and registered in seconds. 
To all those who can’t register their mobile number... remove the 0 if you see +61 prefix...
🤪"
au;5;Took only half a minute to set up, no problems despite reviews earlier saying that had problems (I’m using an old iPhone)
au;5;A lot of people had problems, but it worked perfectly for me.
au;5;"The following information 
“ When the app recognises another user, it notes the date, time, distance and duration of the contact and the other user’s reference code. The COVIDSafe app does not collect your location.”
should repeat that phone
“nor records the phone number of a person in Bluetooth vicinity”
You should as well inform clearly what is recorded at the central server during registration (unique ID allocated during registration, and other data provided at that time: phone no, name, post code of normal location)

Public announcements should warn about multiple similar application (one from Abu Dhabi seems to allow register Australian phone number) and clearly promote to look for Australian Health Dpt as owner/supplier and make icon of this app visible through whole promotion"
au;5;Phone number worked fine for me. Left out the leading zero if that helps
au;5;"“Andrew, I’m sorry, you’ve had several questions,” the prime minister said. “Andrew, I’m sorry, Andrew. I know, but you don’t run the press conference, OK? So I’m going to go to other questions of members of the group. Katharine hasn’t had a question,”
“I’m happy to return to you but let’s just keep it civil. Katharine?”"
au;5;Download this app so we can get busy with living
au;5;No problem downloading and registering. Code came through within seconds. Easy process (for me anyway)
au;5;Working ok for me! 26/4 8:45pm
au;5;Downloaded and registered with no dramas
au;5;"App works great, phone verified instantly, doesn’t drain battery. If you’re worried about privacy I suggest going back to your home screen and deleting every other app on your phone too.

Whatever it takes to get out country running again."
au;5;I just hope everyone else uses it too, so we can get back to normal faster.
au;5;Everything worked, the whole thing took 30 seconds, not sure why all these other people are having issues.
au;5;The app is simple to use and works well!
au;5;"Signed up . No problems, iOS current version all good with mobile number & verification pin via mobile #.
Looking forward to getting back to a few normal things, starting to look like Casper!"
au;5;The app is easy to setup, no issues
au;1;Can’t get past the verify mobile screen!
au;5;Quick and simple install and setup using iOS.
au;3;Won’t accept phone number to send pin on iphone - amended star as now working.
au;5;"Are the people getting a sign up error dropping the zero from their phone number? 
It has the +61 so don’t include 0
Like 404 123 123"
au;5;Logging in was a breeze. No problem at all.
au;5;Easy to set up and nice interface
au;4;I had no trouble setting it up, let’s hope it helps.
au;5;Simple to install, SMS message with confirmation code came through straight away. So easy.
au;5;It appears that any initial registration errors have been fixed.
au;5;Write your number slowly, I had to try it. It works :)
au;5;I was able to download & install first attempt
au;5;Must have fixed the early issues as I completed registration in a few minutes with each step clearly explained.
au;4;"To all the muppets who can’t verify their mobile number, it’s because you are a muppet, not that the app is broken.
I guess you’ve never been overseas before.
When your number is prefixed with +61, you drop the zero at the start of your mobile number.
ENTER YOUR PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT THE ZERO AT THE START."
au;4;Include the “0” in your phone number and it’s takes 1 min to setup and verify.
au;5;Hurry and download Australia so I can stop washing my hands!
au;5;"No issues with registering 
Possibly all the problems others were having was a high demand issue"
au;5;Not sure what the problem with the phone number was? Surely the ‘+61’ part wasn’t confusing people? Just drop the first digit idjits!
au;5;The app only started accepting registrations from 6pm AEST Sunday 26th April. If it didn’t work it should now.
au;5;"Downloaded and signed up within a couple of mins. 

Looks well designed app and hope it and I can play my part to keep all safe and get back to some kind of normal. 

As a chauffeur driver it’s great to know if I have been exposed."
au;5;No problems registering on a Telstra/iPhone device 6:40pm 26/04
au;5;Excellent app
au;5;Took 20 seconds to register. You can’t say that about most apps. People need to take a reality check on privacy concerns - particularly if they are on social media.
au;5;Sign up to save lives and get Australia moving again.
au;5;Only errors if you downloaded before 6pm. They said it would be ready from 6pm for anyone that wants to leave the house in 2020. Otherwise please do not leave your house for the next 8 months.
au;5;Quick and easy to install
au;5;Took me literally 5 seconds to sign up.
au;5;Setup was way quicker and easier than I thought it would be. Nice work!
au;5;Registration worked fine for me. Smooth as.
au;1;Pin sent not working.
au;5;Quick and easy
au;5;If you had problems registering earlier please try again. It is working now. Please share with friends and family.
au;4;People that are having trouble registering their phone no just drop the 0 at the start of your number. +614******* instead of 04********.
au;5;Verification worked for me, guess just wait to see what happens...
au;4;Eventually got into through the phone number section and now all good. Takes a little time to verify phone number but only first few hours of being available. MLIGC
au;5;Saw many 1-star reviews here because people couldn’t register. Worked without a glitch for me, will keep this app on for the next couple of months.
au;5;Just registered and no issue with mobile no like other reviews. Maybe they have a fix already
au;5;Quick and simple
au;5;"I read all the reviews that said they couldn’t enter a phone number. As they were all written before the app was activated at 6 pm on 26/4, I presume that was the issue. 
I applied at 8.30 pm and got straight on. It was a very quick and easy process."
au;5;Registration worked fine, battery life seems unchanged so far.
au;5;"Was a breeze to set up
If you don’t use it - then expect to pay on one way or another. Increased health risks for all, more Isolation potentially and more economic pain for all.
So get on board and spread the word"
au;5;The easiest app to download. I understand that some people are having trouble with the mobile phone number. Given the mobile starts with the Australian international prefix (+61) you then need to enter your mobile without the first 0, e.g. (+61) 400 000 000.
au;4;Downloaded the app and no issue.
au;5;Easy to install. Put your mobile number without the 0.
au;4;Hoping this app genuinely help managing Covid spread efficiently.
au;5;No problem installing. Accepted my mobile number straight away. I dropped the first 0 as country code was in front
au;5;Drop the zero off the front of ya mobile number
au;5;Top notch
au;5;When downloading do not put a zero infront of your mobile number. It won’t add your number if you put it as +6104... must just be +614...
au;5;"Super easy to install and complete... no issues at all and accepted phone number no problems.
Hoping that this will help ease restrictions sooner"
au;5;Early teething problems experienced by early adopters seems to have been resolved now. Quick and easy sign up!
au;5;Took less than a minute - all sorted
au;5;"Done didn’t go live untill 6pm registered and done in 1minute 
Everyone please get on board this will save lives and help us get back to normal life"
au;5;"Great idea. Cmon Australia get behind this app and tell COVID-19 to rack off. 

If lots download this we can get back to barbies and picnics down the coast."
au;4;Assuming you remove the first ‘0’ from your mobile number - as when there is international code the first ‘0’ isn’t needed - it registered straight away and was up and running in less than 30 seconds
au;5;Make sure you are using mobile data, disconnect any wifi connection. Let’s all do our part in returning to a normal life!
au;5;Easy to sign up to. Great concept.
au;5;"Use this app easy to set up
Stay safe"
au;3;You couldn’t register because registration didn’t open until 6pm Sunday night. It was fine after that.
au;5;Works fine now. Apparently wasn’t open till 6pm
au;5;Last 9 digits of your mobile works great
au;5;Verified number without difficulty. Launch was at 6pm. Took about 10s to install and verify at 7.
au;3;Wouldn’t accept my number much like all the other reviews. I turned off Wifi and used the mobile network and it worked. If you’re having trouble registering too perhaps temporarily turn wifi off and try again.
au;5;Updated IOS before installing and it was a quick registration once installed. It is running well in background.
au;5;When entering your mobile number, the app shows the Australian international code (+61) so type everything after the first 0, for example, if your number is 0412 345 678, you only need to input “412 345 678” because the international code is at the start
au;5;I had no difficulty registering my phone number which many people are struggling with. I left the leading “0” off when registering.
au;5;Signed up in 10 seconds and ready to go. Look forward to going to the pub 🤙🏼
au;1;"I can’t get my phone number verified.
Great concept here but I’m unable sign up..."
au;4;Easy and the set up works fine. Drop the leading “0” from your phone number. 👍
au;5;Registered without any problems.
au;5;Set up with no problems. Small download too. Happy to do my bit for Australia.
au;1;There shouldn’t be any reason to leave the app running when it could just use app background refresh. This app has been poorly designed and nothing is actually in the app rather online.
au;5;Make sure you don’t use the first 0 of your phone number
au;5;Entered a number with a 0 and it worked first go
au;3;Works fine
au;5;Registration activation from 6pm AEST on day of release. Get on board peoples... help me, help you!
au;3;Can’t download it.
au;5;When u put your number in drop the first 0 in your number. The app has +61 which is Aus international prefix you need to drop the first 0 then you will get the code ie if number is 012345678 you enter 12355678
au;5;Works fine no problems
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number.
au;5;News outlets said to wait to 6pm to register. Predictably, people ignored that advice and tried to register prematurely and then complained when it didn’t work. Go figure. Great initiative! Everyone get around it.
au;5;just leave the 0 off your phone number
au;5;Earlier issues with I not able to verify my phone number and get the pin, but now all working fine. Important to download so we can all get back to work.
au;5;"Easy to use. No issues with phone number. As the +61 is also ready there you don’t need the ‘0’ at the start of the mobile number. Perhaps some people are starting with 0 rather than 4. 
Let’s stop the spread!"
au;3;Number verification worked fine for me. See some other people having issues but with my phone it worked. Have 13.4.1 version of iOS installed on my phone.
au;5;"Set up is quick and easy, all up and running in under 5 minutes.

All the reviews with complaints about not being able to register their phone number are most likely putting in a 0 at the start. Note the 61, it’s then your number without the leading zero."
au;5;Downloaded and all seems to be working.
au;5;"Just downloaded app and I was able to verify my mobile phone number and receive the pin. I left the zero off the start of my number, not sure if that’s necessary though.
Working fine."
au;5;Signed up in 60 seconds. No problem verifying my mobile phone number
au;5;The reason for this was the app was available to download but you couldn’t actually register until 6pm on Sunday night!!
au;5;Easy and quick set up
au;5;I have been able to install the app and it has allowed me to register my details, no issues. This app seems like a great idea to help track the spread of Covid 19.
au;5;No problems in registration.  iPhone app is sweet.
au;5;Signed up with no problem first time.
au;4;Improvement suggestion. Set an anonymous  home location and use location services to send you a notification to turn the app on when you leave your home location. This would allow you to have the app running only when you leave your anonymous home location. You only need the app running when you leave home.
au;5;I had to input my phone number a few times for it to work. I’m usually paranoid however no issues with privacy on this one. Heck you give more information to google and facechook. At least this might get us back to a realistic normality sooner.
au;5;People leaving 1* when they were told don’t register until after 6pm 🤣🤣🤣
au;5;Quick and easy to setup. Leave the 0 off the start of your phone number and it verifies instantly. Great idea. Take off your tin foil hats and do what you need to for everyone to get through this sooner.
au;5;Get on it.
au;5;"You drongos just need to take the first 0 out of your number when you register. 

Privacy policy says all data collected will be eliminated at the end of the pandemic."
au;5;I waited until after 6pm to sign up as was advised and had no issues at all, seamless sign up.
au;5;Easy to register. Just beauty.
au;5;All the reviews saying they couldn’t verify their number didn’t read or listen to the launch of the app stating that they can fully register their mobile number after 6pm AEST. No issues registering my mobile number after 6pm. Try again if you had problems earlier.
au;5;Download, installed OK, registered easy - reminder to omit the initial zero since it prompts with the international +61 code. Works fine after that.  IOS inserts the pin code automatically making it easy.
au;4;Installed and running fine. Let’s see how it goes. Great effort in designing such an app.
au;5;Super easy to activate, took less than a minute. If it gets us through this sooner, it’ll be worth it!
au;5;Phone number verification now works.
au;5;Able to register with no problems. Obviously as it has just been released, everything is super busy with people trying to register so please be patient and try again later!
au;5;I registered after the 6pm opening time and had no problems. The people complaint about invalid phone number obviously have ignored the information
au;5;Registered in 1 minute. Nice work.
au;5;Easy set up.  Great initiative
au;5;Simple multi step process to sign up. No problems. Looking forward to be able to go out of this app helps. Shared with family and friends.
au;5;My phone number was verified in a few seconds. I didn’t have any problems, works fine.
au;5;Installed no with issues.
au;5;All works as it should be, I suppose. Phone registration passed  through without issues
au;4;Suspect a lot of people may not realise they need to drop the ‘0’ when recording their mobile number when it’s preceded with +61.
au;5;it was a straight forward download and super easy registration
au;1;Someone didn’t test well before you promoted ??
au;5;All worked great in my phone.
au;5;Worked great - Was easy to use, hopefully will save lives!
au;5;Amazing app. Hope enough people get it to finally rid these restrictions. 👍🏼
au;5;"I don’t know why so many people have issues registering their mobile numbers.

When entering your mobile number, don’t enter the leading zero (0) of your number (as your number is preceded by the country code). Hope that helps!"
au;5;"Everyone should download this app to contribute in saving lives.
To the many people reporting an error with the app accepting phone number. That was because at that time registration had not yet been opened ."
au;5;Easy registration and setup.  I checked this app out and it is secure.  The government only gets access to the data if we ever get infected and volunteer the data.
au;5;easy to setup done in less than a minute   Hope this can get things back to normal
au;5;Phone number worked fine you’ve just gotta do 10 digits
au;5;Easy to setup and forget. Verification of phone number worked without issue.
au;5;"Don’t get Wuhanned, fight the bugs, do your duty for the empire ;)."
au;5;Forget the +61, you need to put your whole number.
au;1;App is unresponsive on some screens. “I agree” button greyed out because the consent checkbox cannot be tickled.
au;5;Works a treat. App must have had an update as I was easily able to verify my number. Very simple to use and had no confusions navigating through the sign up.
au;5;Registration only went live at 6pm which is why so many have had issues registering. No problems here, very smooth process. 👍
au;5;A great app. Registered with ease and well this is going to be for the future of Australia.
au;5;Keep Australia safe!! Works fine.
au;5;"Registration for this started 6pm Sydney time - after it was available for download. So if it wasn’t working for you before, try registering now.

Absolutely download and run this. This will save greater than zero lives."
au;4;"Installed this App to help Health Care workers trace CV patients quickly, and protect friends and family and the whole community. 
Easy to use. Well thought out."
au;5;Read the previous reviews with registration issues. No problems for me. Was quick and simple.
au;5;Easy to register
au;5;Fast and easy to download and register. Let’s got onboard and beat this together!
au;5;Great idea.
au;5;Good
au;5;All good! No problem installing or using 👍
au;5;If it didn’t work before it should work now
au;5;If you seriously think this app will take more data to the government you have to be crazy. The fact you’re on a phone now looking at this review means they’re tracing you.
au;5;Not sure if the error was temporary/has now been fixed, but the mobile verification worked for me.
au;5;The app works perfectly fine on my iPhone and I appreciate the step taken by our government to keep us safe.
au;5;No problem registering. Perhaps server was overloaded early on, hence problem for early adopters.
au;5;"When typing in the number,do not put the first 0.
Everything is good right now,hope it will help.And making Australia great again"
au;1;Can’t get past the mobile number stage.  Have even tried without putting the 0 in front.
au;5;Let’s defeat this virus and get back to normal sooner.
au;5;I love this app.. lots of fun features... and it gets harder with every level!!! I’m stuck on Level 7 but I’m determined to finish the game! I hear Sco-mo is the boss at the end! Can’t wait!!!
au;5;Signed up to the app after 6.00pm on day of release and everything worked fine. All registered ok.
au;5;Very quick and easy to verify
au;1;When installing it won’t go past 60%
au;5;Easy and quite download and register. Little information collected and very clear how the app would be used
au;5;Downloaded quickly, installed easily and was very quick to set up. Thank you
au;5;Reviews who said they could not upload their phone numbers didn’t wait until the 6pm launch time today. Try again guys - so we can all get back to some kind of normal life
au;5;"Hi all
You you need drop the 0 from tour mobile numbers. As it is set up as international standard.  61 for Australia. Then drop the 0 and start with your 4"
au;5;To put your phone number in you have to remove all brackets, spaces and hyphens when you automatically put your phone number in.
au;3;Let’s stop this virus together
au;5;Download it now!
au;5;Super easy to navigate through the 3-4 steps to set up the app. Once it’s installed and you’ve given the expected permissions, you just let it run in the background and it will do its thing.
au;5;I m in
au;5;Worked perfectly!! Great job Aus government
au;5;Super easy to use.
au;5;Easy to install and understand privacy. Do it for Australia!!
au;1;I think it won’t work because I have another device with the same info
au;5;Had no issues installing and verified with my mobile number perfectly.
au;5;I think the app is a great idea, and for those who can’t get past the phone number verification question, ensure you DON’T include the zero at the start of your mobile number. After the country code of 61, add your mobile phone number, without the zero at the start. Wondering if this may have been your problem, as mine went through easily first go.
au;5;You must enter your mobile number without the first 0. It’s standard when +61 is the prefix.
au;5;Takes less then 30 seconds to download and activate.
au;5;For those having trouble registering, don’t but the first 0 in for your phone number! Start with the 4, this is why you can’t complete registration
au;5;"For everyone saying they cannot enter mobile- 
Please omit the zero at the beginning of your mobile number as it’s a 61 area code entry. Then it should be fine. 

Stay safe everyone. This will help us contain this virus...."
au;5;Didn’t initially send verification code out, but when I turned off wifi and re-started app installation it worked perfectly
au;5;Worked perfectly.  Not sure why everyone is having so much trouble verifying number. I had no issue at all
au;5;Worked first time as advertised . Ignore all the idiots that tried to register before registration was open.
au;4;To those who are having trouble registering your mobile number- you have to drop the leading zero of you phone number eg instead of 0409.... type 409... it’s in my international phone number format.
au;5;Installed and registered in less than a minute. Simple and easy
au;5;Took just 30 seconds to set up, really important we all get behind it and help stop the spread of Covid-19!
au;5;Straightforward to download. For those concerned re privacy this app holds less information than Facebook or any other social media site, you also can use a pseudonym. For all those users who have had trouble verifying phone number, try downloading again and you need to omit the 0 at start of your number to enter it in international format. And you only need to have it open in background of your phone, your iPhone does not need to be unlocked.
au;5;I can’t believe some people are concerned about privacy on an issue like this, but only too happy to allow social media platforms to share their images, location, and other info with the whole world.
au;5;Expected difficulty in registering given the bad reviews. However, is was really simple and I had no problems on my iPhone X
au;5;Super easy to sign up.
au;4;"This is working fine for me to login. Everything seemed very straightforward to register.

I dud have some initial privacy concerns when the app was first discussed, but the Bluetooth approach seems a pretty reasonable balance between tracking and privacy.

Fingers crossed it works to actually manage contact tracing easily."
au;5;Works well - took me less than a minute to register. Finally some technology that can make a difference!
au;5;Everything is working well for my app, and I’m sure it will keep Australia safer from COVID-19. Great job guys 👍🏼.
au;5;Let’s get through this together.
au;5;Thanks Scomo
au;5;It all worked perfectly. No issues. Very important app during these distressing times.
au;1;"Awesome... I’m behind this app as I think we should all be doing our bit. 

But it won’t allow me to verify my telephone number!
🤦‍♂️"
au;1;Great concept if people could get past the verification of phone number. Will wait to see  when it gets fixed
au;5;Let the great tracking commence!
au;3;Thisapp has major acceessiblity issues. Buttons not label correctly, the verify button was not detected by VoiceOver, labels of edit fields are not correctly labelled and more. Very disappointing for such a simple app and from the government. As Covid-19 impacts everyone and some care should have been done to ensure everyone can access the app.dor
au;2;If it gets us out of stinking lockdown then sign me up
au;1;Tried to sign up but can’t because it won’t verify my phone number.
au;2;Ok, Australian health officials, you need to fix this quick. You need to fix the search problems. Search COVID, does not find the app, Search COVID safe, two words, guess what doesn’t find the app. ONLY if you search COVIDSAFE, as one word then it comes up.  IT people often to clever for us common people.
au;5;corona virus isn’t real it’s israel
au;5;You need to have the lasted IOS Software update installed on your phone if you can’t verify your mobile number.
au;5;Works perfectly after 6pm at which point you could register your number. It’s secure, private and non-pervasive. We’ll executed Straya!
au;5;Downloaded smooth, asks for minimal info, let’s get Australia open again!
au;5;As an Australian we should all be doing all we can to flatten to curve and support contact tracing. I hope this app helps get us all back to our normal daily routine quicker. 🇦🇺
au;5;"I’m happy to report that the first attempt at signing up for the app was successful.

It was a very simple process and I encountered zero problems.

I’m not saying that other people have not had issues, but I am saying that I have had none."
au;4;Works well
au;5;Quick and easy to install if you want to get out of this isolation just download the app so we can all get on with life
au;5;Installed details without issue and verified. Hopefully this works and we can get back to more normal life soon.
au;5;Installs and registers fine. Don’t know why all the -ve comments.  Perhaps turn your Bluetooth on and accept permission requests.  App works fine
au;5;Easy setup. No problems
au;5;"People really need to read info provided for when the software will be switched on. 

App was released a few hours before the servers were switched on that enabled mob numbers to be verified.

App works perfectly 😀"
au;1;Can only access code by exiting the app but when I return the app sends you back to the beginning of registering, therefore unable to register.
au;5;"I hope people get on board. I have no issue with privacy concerns. The code has been open sourced to public scrutiny and found to work as described. 

Using google or Facebook is FAR FAR more intrusive then what this does. So anyone complaining about privacy is ignorant. 

WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO SUBSEQUENTLY TESTS POSITIVE CORONA VIRUS!?

Good work to the devs. Just hopefully all your work was in vein and we crush the virus. Let’s hope Aussies are smart enough to all get on board protect each-other with Bluetooth and don’t listen to idiots like Barnaby Joyce who literally have no idea."
au;5;"Ok, maybe a bit of hyperbole, but seriously. On ANZAC day weekend, the least you can do for your country is potentially give up a little privacy. We need 40% uptake for it to be effective. Let’s stop the tinfoil hats and just make this work.

Because of my profession, I’m VERY familiar with information security, the importance of data privacy, and how data can be exploited. From what I can tell, this app has been created with the highest standards and the best of intentions.

Before you criticise it for nefarious motives, read the privacy policy, and SEE what great lengths they have gone to make sure it is effective, but minimally invasive.

And the UX is nice too, which is a welcome change from previous government apps."
au;5;Others have said it won’t go past the mobile number verify screen.. it’s all working now.
au;1;"Doesn’t use the new Apple frameworks that would make this app actually useful.

Rewrite it with these in mind and I will use this."
au;1;Just keeps crashing when I try and sign up , uninstalled.
au;5;"Fantastic App ScoMo 
Happy todo my part mate"
au;5;Scomo.... You’re a true leader that’s leading the way over the world. Privacy is not an issue. All details are stored in the phone. Easy to setup and operate! Can’t wait to get back out into the real world. Just have to hope Dopey Dan the Communist also gets behind it, his arrogance leaves him wanting to run his own ship.
au;5;Easy to set up. Let’s show the world, Australia can beat this virus.
au;5;"The app uses Bluetooth not GPS and data is only stored on your phone until you manually upload your information.
Looks like good secuirty and able to make contact tracing much easier for the health officials."
au;5;Easy to setup
au;5;Great to see a Government app that is simple and straight forward to use
au;5;"Thanks Gov for making this - it works, it’s clean, and it’s a great solution to get Australia back up and running.
Get it!!"
au;5;"What’s the worst that could happen do
We want to end up
Like America"
au;3;iPhone 6 with current iOS version doesn’t report Bluetooth enabled correctly nor register as an app for Bluetooth sharing permissions.
au;4;was able to put my phone number in and register fine!
au;5;Very quick and easy. Definitely worth it! 💪
au;1;"Just can’t trust that this app does what the Government claim. It only has one feature which sends your data to the Government - there isn’t even a feature to allow you to see your own data !!! 

If trust is to be earned, tra spare Xu is essential."
au;1;The government can’t protect the personal information of our police officer’s. They’ve proven inept at keeping data secure in the past so why would you trust them with yours?
au;5;Hopefully Australians embrace this. The life you save could be your own, or that of an ill family member.
au;5;No issues at all, easy to download an intuitive  to follow
au;5;Happy to help keep COVID contained. This is a small thing I can do!
au;5;Download and together we can beat the virus
au;5;To anyone suspicious of a “tracking” app - this doesn’t even use gps. Seriously your already on a smart phone with social media and google that are ACTUALLY tracking every tiny detail in your life. Move along and help everyone else stay healthy and get some normal life back
au;5;"I’m happy for our elected govt to have my location data for management of this as well as any future epidemics.

Big brother is watching - it’s just not the same big brother George Orwell forecast  all those decades ago."
au;5;This app has privacy guaranteed and is a big step to us Australians returning to our regular lives! Thanks SCOMO. We’re on our way.
au;5;Glad we have followed suit from some other countries and developed this app. Should help greatly with contact tracing. Let’s hope this works well!
au;5;Saving lives!!!
au;5;this is a fantastic idea to help people once they have tested positive to tell people who have been around them to self isolate
au;5;Let’s hope plenty people realise that they just aren’t that interesting for the government to track their every movement, and get behind the app.  Good on the Aussie government for using innovative solutions to track this disease.
au;2;Won’t install on iPhone 4
au;5;Best innovative strategy to keep people safe. Wish other countries can learn from this
au;5;Takes less than a minute to download
au;5;Let’s go Aussie! Let’s give Covid the boot!
au;5;I think it’s great the government is adapting to the times and using technology to help us contain and control this outbreak. Thank you for making this possible.
au;5;Easy to set up and an essential tool in fighting this invisible Deamon.
au;1;While trying to signup after installing. An annoying image of covidsafe keeps popping it difficult to fill in details.
au;1;Your app is bugged. Can’t rego because the app restarts after I switch app to check the one time passcode.
au;3;It was a bit hard to register when the title screen keep popping in and out. Please fix! Otherwise. Easy setup and we are allowed to use fake names.
au;5;This is not the greatest app of all time. This is just a tribute.
au;5;👍
au;5;I am on board.
au;1;Keeps crashing during registration
au;5;Excellent app, keeping the public safe
au;5;"If we all get this right we can move past this lockdown, save lives and be free again.

Don’t stuff it up for all of us. Please."
au;5;Great idea. This will help open up Australia if enough of us use it.
au;5;Every bit helps
au;5;dunno if it’s the apps fault but as soon as i downloaded it i felt sick! is this the app or is it just me????
au;4;"I would trust this app more if verifying my phone number was optional. 

I don't want a phone number Bluetooth MAC address correlation ending up in the wrong hands. 

Having said that, the rest of the security seems sound at this stage. 

Deleted for now, waiting in hope for ver 1.1.

Thanks for your hard and quick work getting this out!"
au;5;I’m good to go :)
au;5;Simple to set up and fast to download.
au;5;Easy to use
au;5;Easy to install and use for the safety of everyone
au;5;Xx
au;5;Great work stop the spread.
au;4;During this pandemic downloading of this app is the most imp thing. Thank Aus Gov!!
au;5;Easy to use, nice UI, great app
au;5;Its an app to keep our children safe at school or in tertiary institutions. Let’s us know very quickly if someone around us that has proven positive to Coronavirus and take action very quickly. All Australians need to get behind this app.
au;1;App isn’t working - it tells me my details are not correct.it wont accept my phone number which is correct,
au;5;People throw their whole lives on Facebook but worry about an app that can actually help save lives. Government already has your tax file, rego,medical,financial. If needed they can track your movements on phone cell towers and have the meta data from your internet. Put your tin hat in the draw and download the app for your family's sake.
au;5;Quick to install. Privacy policy is clear to read through. A very simple app that does only appear to have one purpose.
au;5;Since I downloaded and installed this app I still haven’t caught COVID-19 so it must be working 🤣. Seriously - happy to download it if it means Australia gets out of lockdown sooner and helps saves lives.
au;3;It would be good if it notified you of contacts it is registering. If I live alone and am watching TV and tomorrow morning it has decided that I have been in close contact with my upstairs neighbour then we have a problem.
au;1;I tried to enter my mobile number but it didn’t work,
au;5;It’s very nice
au;5;Installed the app. My ex girlfriend came back. My friend paid me the money he owed. My kids started behaving. My car is now running smoothly. I got covid 19, but still. Pretty good outcome.
au;5;As Aussie’s we have to do our part. I have no issue with privacy concerns given I use google, Waze, amazon and various other apps that monitor my activities and movements in a much more invasive, and less worthwhile, way than this potentially life saving app!
au;5;If this helps us with getting back to business it is worth it .
au;5;Good incentive
au;5;Scmo told me to download it
au;5;Hello, can you please make this app available for all countries in the Apple App Store. Some people don’t have Australian Apple Store accounts and can’t download this app, but they still reside in Australia.
au;5;I am not a Criminal or a dumb Socialist whining about privacy issues(clearly they don’t understand how it works) , so I have downloaded. I will help stop the spread.
au;4;"Impressed by ease of install.
As it’s Australian only, remove the country code and allow ppl to put in their typical mobile number (prefix with 0 instead of +61)... this will save some ppl from claiming it doesn’t work"
au;5;Excellent App. Well compiled. Easy to download and implement. Highly recommended.
au;1;The app is completely glitching from the main screen to the black covidsafe screen.
au;5;Good idea down load the app help save Australia.
au;5;This is the best use of technology for direct benefit to Australian communities.
au;2;Touched wrong button trying to scroll for my age. Can’t correct, no chance to correct!
au;5;G’Day Sir! Cheers!
au;5;I was first to review I win
au;5;Not as good as angry birds but not bad
au;5;"Very easy to set up. I hope this gets us one step closer to normal.
Stay safe"
au;1;"Tried verifying two people on two different phones. Neither was able to verify. 

If an app fails before even reaching the start line, why bother releasing it!"
au;5;"I guess as long as you are not a crim, you have nothing to worry about. 
App was easy to use, download and forget."
au;5;Straight forward activation. Privacy policy seems boiler plate. It’s not tracking my location and based on the information sites the legal, security and privacy provisions seem solid.
au;5;Hi! Is anyone can add the health information through this app or just the COVID-19 effected people can add? Please assist me. Thanks
au;5;You don’t have to use your name, just enter your mobile number and you’ll be notified if you’ve come into close contact with a COVID19 case and if you happen to catch it they can use this info to let others know.
au;5;Do your bit to help Australia get over this rubbish
au;5;Great initiative ! Let’s all get this app so we can get back to our normal lives 👍🏼
au;5;I’m in!
au;5;If people were not so impatient, they would find that the logon works and the app will do as directed. As far a privacy goes most people give out more detail on social media
au;5;First
au;1;I’m unable to register as the COVIDSafe entry screen keeps displaying as I try to enter information. It’s not very reassuring to register my information with an app that looks to be faulty. Please address.
au;5;Thank you for keeping us safe!!
au;1;Registration doesn’t work if you have an apostrophe in your surname - will fail after you put in your phone number. Work around is to take the apostrophe out of your name.
au;5;"I want to be safe, I wang my family and elderly mother to be safe. If we’re near someone who was to be ill I would want to know for our safety. I know a certain independent federal minister may try be pushing a political point and her own publicly over privacy, but this is Australia and every government of the day has good intentions. Be safe, down load it and let’s beat this virus by all of us doing our part. 
Blue collar worker..."
au;5;Chill and Fun app, kids love playing and good for passing the time!
au;5;Safe, efficient, effective way to help us to continue to lead the world in the covid19 response. Privacy concerns are silly, encourage everyone to download this to do their bit to help us open up again ASAP
au;5;Hassle free setup
au;4;Let’s kick the virus and then we can get on with our lives
au;5;Just do it!
au;5;All Australians should help the community and download the app
au;5;Happy to download and do what most be done.
au;5;This was super hard to find and If you don’t have an Australian number I cannot verify. This is an issue.
au;5;The app installed without a hitch. Hopefully it will help Australia to continue minimising the impact of the global pandemic. I’m prepared to share my info if it helps save lives.
au;5;The most secure app will help us keep track of the coronavirus, leading to much quicker identification and treatment of cases.
au;5;Excellent idea! I’m all for anything that’ll help stop the spread! Download, stage safe, stop the spread!
au;5;Easy app to use. Setup simple. Hard to find the app though. The Australian government needs to advertise the app more so more people use it otherwise it’s pointless
au;5;"You’re willing to give up “freedoms” to giant US tech corporations who where you have very little recourse, but you’re worried about an update that collects not even half the data. 

Get real, download it and move onto your next Netflix binge."
au;4;"It was easy. 
I was reluctant though to let it supposedly invite others via my mail list."
au;5;TXT verification is glitching to the extreme.
au;5;Easy to use, easy to set up, great tool to mitigate pandemics.
au;5;Simple to install, and clear interface. Independent privacy review makes this a no-brainer.
au;5;Can’t wait for the conspirators to blow up
au;1;Practically unusable. Ripe with bugs. Expected something better from the government in times like these.
au;5;The setup process was very straight-forward! A simple app for an important purpose.
au;5;This will definitely flatten the curve
au;5;Would be good to be able to report when near sniffy, coughing people and if that reported person ends  up being a super spreader give them legal penalties. Think major problem is symptomatic people not isolating need to be taught a lesson.
au;5;Hey Jordy
au;4;Good app, needs to be able to download on iPad with multiple devices using same number so I can track my daughters contact as I have shared care.
au;5;Just coughed in my room! The microphone picked it up and alerted my family downstairs! Now I can’t leave, great.....
au;1;The screen keeps flashing and registration cannot be completed Serious problem
au;5;idk
au;1;The app will not register my mobile
au;5;It is easy to setup, only needs Name, age range (not DOB), postcode and phone number. Help end lockdowns - get the app!
au;5;Great
au;1;You have to run this app in the foreground to make it work. It won’t work in the background.
au;1;Can’t get past first few steps as it won’t recognise my mobile number in set up. Please help.
au;5;.
au;3;Only issue is that it doesn’t have enough Aus Government branding on it. Cautious about using something that doesn’t have enough official information
au;5;If this allows restrictions to be lifted then make it compulsory to quicken up the process
au;1;"It makes me sad that  the Government wait for the Apple & Google framework to be released. The gain in having it work in the background would have been worth a few additional weeks in my eyes. 

It’s a bit worrying that people might develop a false sense of security and take more risks. The home screen literally has a pulsating shield. 

Please be transparent about why the decision was made to not use the Apple & Google framework."
au;5;What the government is doing is rather PogU, I would say. Coronavirus is a very weirdchamp situation, and if downloading this app means I can omegalul with my friends sooner, then that’s a lolW.
au;5;26-abr
au;1;Just keeps saying please enter in correct mobile?
au;1;Developed by the Chinese Communist Government in partnership with the Australian government to help trace and track citizens
au;5;Up there
au;2;Honestly, I thought this app would make me safe from Covid? But when I gone out and licked a pole, this app stood futile, i’m now infected with COVID-19. I honestly do not recommend this app for other users. Misdirection and misogyny.
au;5;"This application is a great initiative to helping the tracking of people who have been confirmed to have contracted SARS-CoV-2, and I would recommend that everyone in Australia downloads this application, regardless of how often you leave your property. You just need to have a phone number you can easily be contacted by and have Bluetooth enabled on your iPhone; you don’t even require a SIM card, so you could, in theory, download this to your iPod Touch or iPad as well if you carry it around with you everywhere. It also takes up a small ≈5.2MB of storage on your device, so if you only have 16GB of storage on your device, or perhaps even less, it shouldn’t cause any issues regarding your device storage."
au;5;Very easy to install and use.
au;5;Absolutely amazing! I feel so much safer in these tough times
au;5;The positives of the use around this app far outweigh the negatives. Let’s do our best to control this virus and not lose our sanity!
au;5;Everyone should download this to keep our friends and family safe.  There is a lot of other apps on my phone that collect a lot more data than this does, so anyone who thinks this is a privacy invasion needs their head examined. #iamcovidsafe
au;1;Can’t seem to register says my valid phone number is invalid and I can’t proceed.
au;5;Message for App developers.  When searching iOS store, I typed Covid Safe as 2 words.  Search results were none.  (Tried again typing Covidsafe as 1 word & found the App).  Suggest the word search in iOS store is corrected, with either 1 or 2 word search should lead me to the App.  We don’t to lose people at the download stage.
au;5;Easy to install. Works first time.
au;5;A lot of people around Australia have suffered because of the lockdowns and because of COVID. Please consider you community and download this app. If you use google maps or Uber or credit cards, the government already knows where you are. It will let you know if you’ve come into contact with some one who has COVID. You can delete it again whenever you want. Let’s get back on track.
au;5;Downloaded and registered on this easily in seconds.  App works in the background and will only ‘do something’ if you happen to spend more that 15mins with someone who later tests positive to Covid-18.  Otherwise sits quietly in the background.  Impossible to argue this isn’t working by looking at it.  Think this is a great initiative.
au;5;Easy to install and setup
au;5;Just doing my part & I have nothing to hide from our government!
au;5;This has been so helpful 🦠❤️
au;3;Good cause and I’ll use , but need to keep the app running? Really...
au;1;The app won’t accept my phone number. Tried 6 times
au;5;I like turtles
au;5;I installed the app and so far it has provided 100% protection. I’m still not sick with Covid-19.  It hasn’t helped with my flatulence though.
au;1;ARGHHHHHHH
au;5;"First let me start off by saying I’m an American, as such, liberty and privacy are deeply important. But there is one idea that underlines all of that and that is the value of the community itself, in general the community must be safe, or individual rights and freedoms mean little. Can I having this data, be abused! Absolutely in many different ways. However, I think we have to trust for the sake of the community as a whole and accept the risk to the individual. It is said that those who give up liberty and rights in fear, do not deserve either liberty or rights. That’s not what’s going on here, at least not for me. It’s about safety, I will give up some of my freedom to keep the community safe as a whole. And maybe, just maybe we can come out the other side of all this as a better community, one that actually looks after each other in the world around us. I’m grateful to be in Australia 😌
Ambrose | covid19 - 2020"
au;5;Stay safe and keep everyone safe with this app!
au;5;Great app
au;4;Would not accept mobile phone number to send verification pin as only 1 bar signal. Worked fine thereafter
au;5;"Hoping everyone in Australia will download and keep active so we can all get back to normal soon!

If you’re still unsure, read below and more online before making a decision...
Together we can all help against the virus.

App quick and simple to set-up.

Aus Govt have given enough reassurances on key Privacy questions:

- Voluntary download and usage
- No GPS location data captured
- Data only to be used for COVID contact tracing (and illegal to do otherwise)
Etc...

Mots on their website and usual media..."
au;5;User friendly and easy to sign up
au;3;Great idea but would be great if it would accept valid mobile numbers.
au;5;Speed up the process for tracing infected people compared with hours or days for manual tracing.  Don’t be a boofhead, install it if you want to save lives and speed up loosening restrictions and get people back to work sooner.
au;5;Great stuff
au;3;"I never been tested and i’m  well. I don't have the virus so is it important to install the app? 
Or this is for everyone ?? Please let me know"
au;5;A small community service for the greater good of all of us. Done. Easy.
au;5;Great initiative. Well done Australia. Big data is the future.
au;5;If this helps the country get back to work sooner then I’m all in. Thanks for making this app
au;5;Only requirements are Name, phone no and age bracket
au;5;I would like to thank you for making this app to keep us safe
au;5;This is a great idea to stop the spread. If someone who’s positive comes into contact with me - this makes it easy for me to find out.  I want to know this info.
au;5;Great work I’m glad this app doesn’t track you  and only uses Bluetooth, happy to help
au;5;"Easy to use and setup. 
Thanks for keeping us safe"
au;5;The best app since Angry Birds, it’s free and it could save your life, 5 out of 5 potato mash pies from me.
au;1;Will not verify my mobile phone number.
au;5;Simple, effective, life saving...
au;5;I just downloaded it and didn’t find anything intrusive! I want to be safe and keep the community safe, which is why I installed it 👍
au;5;Boo hoo it’s a good app
au;5;A big FU to the Liberty Australia and everyone else who thinks this app was a bad idea. We care about our safety. You are leeches and lawyers
au;5;This app is really great. I feel it will help a lot with tracking who you should stay away from. Hopefully it will help us get back into normal life sooner.
au;5;Use the app to save jobs!
au;5;We may stay apart but we will be together in this fight.
au;5;The app was very simple to signup to, explains itself clearly and asked for very little personal information.
au;5;Very simple format and easy to use.
au;5;It took 30 seconds to sign up and no issues :)
au;5;Look, it’s worth to use this app if we can recover as a country better due to COVID-19. For people concerned about privacy, this app is no worst than you using Facebook , Google services or TikTok sharing all your personal-information and random photos/socials.
au;5;I support this initiative and we should work together defeating COVID.
au;5;Does “keep the app open” means that it doesn’t run in the background? ie it must always be on as the active app on the screen?
au;5;What’s the chance of getting out for a beer or sitting on the beach if you could prove you had this app open on your phone? Failing that, it’s the best chance we have of lifting some restrictions and trying to keep people safe. There’s more info about you available every time you open your phone, or appear on the TV saying you won’t use this!
au;5;Does the job !
au;4;Aa
au;5;Amazing app first review
au;5;Quick to download & easy to register. Information was clearly presented.
au;5;Please introduce Apple Watch app
au;5;Very good app which helps save us from the pandemic!
au;5;Easy to use, peace of mind
au;5;"Smooth so far - took 1 min to download, register and set up. 

Impressed."
au;5;Happy to join force in protecting fellow Australians from Covid19 virus spread. Please do your duty. It’s so easy to setup clearly not stealing any other privacy information.
au;5;Easy to upload, minimal personal details... get onboard Team Australia 🇦🇺👍
au;5;Worked just like it said. Installation took 1 minute. Support this with all your friends.
au;5;We are in this together stop the spread and stay home, practice social distancing
au;5;Download and stop the spread.
au;1;Literally can’t get past the home screen. It keep flashing back to the black covidsafe screen.
au;5;I’m happily using this app so I can know if I come into contact with a COVID-19 positive person. Hopefully enough others will use this app and we can relax our restrictions sooner.
au;5;walk past me to be arrested
au;5;Great option to eliminate the spread of Covid!
au;5;Easy to download, took 20 seconds to set-up.  Lets do this one small thing to move to the new normal.
au;5;I, a loyal member of the party of Oceania, praise Big Brother, and accept him watching my every move to protect the party!
au;5;Smooth sign up
au;5;So far so good
au;5;Bug fixed, can now add my ph number. Thank you!
au;5;If we all do our bit, we can get rid of this virus and take back our lives.
au;5;Important app everyone should use
au;4;My son can’t download the app because he has an international version of the AppStore, please make this app downloadable in all regions
au;5;Hope everyone downloads it so we can go back to normal
au;1;I followed the prompt steps, however when you are asked to enter your mobile number, the app does not accept. A message appears saying check your details. Which I did and applied different combinations with (+61) and without. Please fix this bug.
au;5;"No problems registering. Very easy.  
We need this! Stay safe everone!"
au;5;If it helps gets life back to normal then I’m all for it.
au;5;Helps to stop the spread of COVID-19
au;5;Quick and easy app that will help save the lives of us Australians
au;5;Great Work
au;5;SUCH A GOOD GAME!
au;5;"Really want to help and use this app but not recognizing my AUSTRALIAN Telstra mobile number as valid

Working now, thanks!"
au;5;Simple process and no issues at all - wouldn’t you want to know if someone with you had the virus? Play your part - help us reopen our country !
au;5;Easy. Let’s do this Australia.
au;5;Thanks for app it may help us saving lives
au;1;You should not be tracking us
au;5;"I am downloading it.. People have privacy concerns around this but it doesnt store your location data. 

It will record whose phone was in close contact with yours while you are in public.. store data encrypted and delete after 21 days.

In todays world we are voluntarily giving so much information to facebook, google, insta, apple through the phone - which we dont know how its used.. so i guess in this case atleast I know the intention behind.

Contributing my bit in a hope to get back to normal life."
au;5;"Easy, seamless install. No crashes or hangs. 
The more of us that install this app, the safer we’ll be."
au;3;"On first try the app didn’t work. Each time I entered my phone number, despite trying variations with and without leading zero, I would get an error message saying the phone number was invalid.
However it worked on a retry after leaving it for about 30 mins and restarting the app."
au;1;All good until I get to the Mobile Phone section where it will not recognise and send me a pin.
au;5;Love the initiative.
au;4;Works now.
au;5;This will certainly make it much quicker for public health to help crush COVID-19 when a case is detected. The more than download it the more it will protect us all.
au;5;You’ve given up your data to Facebook, Google and other large tech companies for years. This is for the greater good. Just install it
au;5;Easy sign up and works perfectly. Will just be a bit inconvenient to remember to have the app open all the time for it to work, however it is definitely worth it.
au;5;Easily the best Australian Government funded covid 19 contact tracing app that I’ve ever downloaded.
au;5;A smart, creative way to help #stopthespread and to get Australia moving again. Was happily surprised at how swift and easy it is to setup. From clicking download to being done took less than 30 seconds.
au;5;Anyone who won’t download it over privacy concerns needs to get a grip.
au;1;i cant even get past the mobile phone number registration screen....
au;5;Wonderful initiative by the Australian government, taking us another step closer to being able to ease lockdown message and keep everyone safe. The more of us cooperate the quicker we’ll get this curse under control.
au;5;I just got it, opened it up and can say that it works very well. Keep it up👍
au;5;Great App in fighting the curve!  Easy to download and register.
au;5;Downloaded and registered in 30 seconds. Works fine.
au;5;Would be more effective with Wearable support for those that are active and don’t take there phone with them.
au;5;Easy to use
au;5;Install and signup was simple and straightforward. Good initiative if people get onboard. Even used a nickname to register.
au;5;Great app. Very happy.
au;5;..
au;1;This app was garbage. I couldn’t even register. Full of bugs. I thought this app was designed to fight bugs. Not create more. Would not recommend.
au;5;"Thank you to all the health experts and leaders that have guided Australia’s response.

Australian’s all thank you and trust you."
au;5;Lets help each other to fight this virus 😷❤️
au;5;"Great to see the limited information gathered, no more than could be found out online about most already. Also great that the only information that is technically required for validation is your mobile number. 

These are strange times and this is a necessary short term solution!"
au;5;Love it, happy to help in this fight! Let me know what else I can do!
au;5;"Great idea, but it needs everyone’s support to work.
No privacy concerns, why would the government want to track my phone for any other purpose?"
au;5;All registered! Let’s all help save the community!
au;4;Great app if helps save lives
au;5;Thanks for the initiative. We need to make this app mandatory.
au;5;Hopefully this proves useful and enough people use it.
au;5;"Thank you Australian Government for all of your hard work and effort for putting this app together.

I’m fully supportive of your efforts."
au;5;The more people embrace these restrictions and new technologies the quicker we’ll see light at the end of the tunnel.
au;5;Easy to set up. Let’s all get behind this and get back to work sooner.
au;4;"This problem was solved after I tried again an hour later: 

When I tried to get the pin by mobile, I got an error message that I need to check my details and try again."
au;5;Stay safe people!
au;5;"The news said it would be active at 6 pm however it worked for me at 5:48 pm and the final screen states that the app is active and I am registered. 

The security measures in place to protect the privacy of users are very comforting and I have no issues in letting the app use my Bluetooth (which is always on anyway) to assist in tracking and controlling the spread of Covid-19"
au;5;Installed and registered with no issues. Doing my part.
au;4;Asks for name, postcode, age bracket and mobile number. Less information the google and Facebook. Seems like only once you’ve been informed you’ve been near someone should it ask for more data..
au;5;Use it to keep your loved ones safe👍
au;5;Get on board for the greater good Australia
au;4;Initially wouldn’t register my phone number but is now working.
au;5;So far no covid.
au;5;Good app to stop the spread of coronavirus doesn’t give the government your pornhub search history so don’t worry about your local member of parliament knowing about your search for muppet bukake party.
au;5;Pleased to sign up. Here is to hoping it works and we can relax the restrictions soon.
au;3;Phone number initially failed to ‘validate’ but the app appears to be working now.
au;5;Easy to install, potential to save lives and allow Australians some freedom to move about again.
au;5;Great concept to get these restrictions eased
au;5;This app helps protect everyone and bring us closer to getting back to normal- a must-download for every Aussie 👌🏽
au;4;Works fine
au;3;Finally it accepted phone number😲
au;1;Will not verify my mobile number tried with zero and without after the+61
au;5;Before it became error, but now it is OK !
au;5;1 minute setup
au;4;It’s not clear whether you need to manually unlock your phone and run the app for this to work
au;1;Very frustrating, the app now recognises my mobile number but hasn’t sent me a pin to complete registration even though I have requested a new one multiple times.
au;1;"Downloaded the app the minute it was released. For some reason the first 25 times I tried to enter my number it told me there was an error registering my number. There’s no links to an actual support line. Deleted the app reinstalled it, then deleted it again and restarted my phone and tried again - NO JOY. Finally tried it again and it just worked?

If you’re having same trouble persevere and it should work eventually - looks like someone skipped the testing. 

Terrible user experience and disheartening the government has managed to screw up something so important."
au;1;Won’t accept mobile number.
au;1;Was prepared to put my qualms about privacy aside for the greater good but the app doesn’t recognise my mobile number so I needn’t have worried
au;1;Can’t past the third screen (verify mobile number). And yes, tried the number with or without the first zero digit.
au;5;All good so far 👍
au;1;I’ve been trying to register my details on the new app & it won’t allow me to go any further than entering my mobile number
au;1;"It won’t recognise the ph number if you use a name different from that which your Apple ph has as its registered name for you

You can’t use a dodgey name or an abbreviation, or nick name"
au;1;"I’m trying to sign up but it keeps coming up with an error saying “error verifying phone number”. I’ve tried with the zero; without the zero; with the +61; without the +61. I’ve tried closing and restarting the app. Tried deleting and reinstalling. I also do have Bluetooth enabled, so I’m not sure what the issue is."
au;5;Very easy to use
au;1;Sounds like a useful app if you want to be involved in Covid 19 tracing, but I can’t  sign up as it won’t recognise any of my phone numbers.  Maybe I just don’t exist.
au;1;Issue with phone number input on an iPhone 7 Plus error states error verifying phone number please check your details and try again. My number I entered is correct. Tried without the 0 due to a +61 in front but still didn’t work.
au;1;Not much more I can say, really?
au;1;Tried to download app. Couldn’t complete my details as it keeps saying error to my phone number I’m adding. My number is correct. Tried it with the 0 prefix and without neither work. Shame.
au;1;Really keen to get downloaded this new app. Hoping it would help to get our life’s back to normal quicker however I’m getting an error message when entering my mobile number :( so can’t use it. Annoying
au;1;No working
au;1;Will not accept mobile number, can only assume because it is a work phone....one less that cannot use.
au;1;Phone number input doesn’t work
au;1;The app won’t accept my mobile number to verify.
au;2;"This app does not support a mobile number. 
Must be a bug."
au;1;Tried it with and without the zero. Want to use this but this seems like a basic error.
au;1;Gives error ‘can not verify mobile number’
au;2;Says there is an error verifying phone number so I can’t actually register
au;1;Tried to register but won’t accept my mobile number.
au;5;Trying to put my phone number in and it won’t allow me to, saying there is an error with my details.
au;1;Can’t upload phone number, comes up with error.
au;1;Got error when trying to put contact no. for verification. Says” ERROR VERIFICATION PHONE NUMBER”
au;1;"Having issue with app accepting mobile number does not matter if i write 0417xxxxxx or 417xxxxxx app says cant verify number check details
What going on"
au;1;Mmm I think I know my mobile phone number to get the verification code sent.
au;2;There’s a bug where it won’t let me validate my number even though I type it correctly
au;5;Keep saying my phone number is invalid, although everything is correct.
au;2;Really wanted to participate but when it won’t accept your phone number, well it’s pretty useless 😫
au;1;Can register phone number
au;5;COVID19 is big danger, stay safe with your families and download the app for your safety
au;2;Giveback error when putting in mobile number. So cannot get the pin.
au;1;Tried to sign up and will not accept my mobile number, deleted and reinstalled app, still won’t accept phone number... sooo until then unfortunately can’t use the app sorry AUSGOV

au;1;Got to the third page and won’t recognise an Australian mobile number with or without the 0 in front. Can’t complete registration.
au;2;It doesn’t accept my phone number. Must be a fault with the app. Shame as I think it’s a great idea.
au;1;Tried to do the right thing by downloading the app. Doesn’t let me register as it falsely  says my mobile number is not valid and can’t be verified, even though it’s correct. No way to feed this back that I have found. Fail at first attempt.

au;1;Won’t except my phone number
au;2;Looks like the app was released prematurely. Trying to complete the registration within the app and after entering the phone number to get the pin I keep getting the messages “Error verifying phone number”. Why release an app when it’s not fully functional. This will only put people off.
au;3;When entering mobile phone number (with and without the 0) gives error when trying to verify number.
au;1;Just trying to do the simplest thing of entering my number to verify and it fails, throwing errors that my number is wrong...need to fix this so we can all work together. And get life back to normal.
au;3;Tried to register my phone/details and the app won’t accept my phone number. Tried it the 2 different ways it could possibly be entered & it doesn’t work. Partner tried to register also on his phone & had the same issue, can’t get passed the phone number part.

Please guide what to do?"
au;5;Can’t wait to go to the pub!
au;1;Downloaded the app and started putting my details. To get PIN number you have to enter your mobile number and that is where is stop. No matter how many time and tried with and without 0 version of mobile number, it keep on giving error. My mobile is always been active but this app cannot recognise it. Maybe test the app first with handful of users prior asking public to use it.
au;1;The app sign up is not letting me sign up. It states when I input my phone number “error verifying phone number. Please check details and try again”
au;1;I just tried to do my civic duty and sign up and it says my mobile phone number isn’t valid. No error on my part. Can’t sign up.
au;5;The app is giving an error message when entering the user's mobile number to verify registration.

au;1;Can’t get past the phone number verification as it comes up with an error. Tried with and without the ‘0’ in front of the number. Happy to set-up once error is fixed.
au;1;Won’t let u register your phone number??
au;5;First review KNEGARRRR
au;1;Can’t get past the “enter your mobile number” step in registration. Just says “Error verifying mobile number. Please check your details and try again”. Which I did - numerous times. Cannot proceed, so cannot use.
au;1;Stalled so long and now won’t even take my mobile number. I guess I’m not going to be allowed to be a user.
au;2;I can’t sign up it keeps on coming up with an error saying can’t verify phone number
au;2;Come on guys !!!!! Need this step to at least be sorted before launching. Jeez.
au;5;Can not complete the registration process on this release. Unable to verify mobile number.
au;1;Tried to register but it tells me it can’t verify my mobile phone number. I put in with a 0 and without. Gave up in the end!
au;5;It will not accept my mobile phone number
au;1;Good start Aust Gov
au;1;Not a good start. I can’t set it up. When will the fix be available?
au;1;I cannot register an Australian telstra mobile number that I have had for years and years
au;1;Doesn’t recognize mobile number either in international or AU format. Useless 🙄
au;1;Won’t accept my mobile number
au;1;I can’t register - app fails to get past entering the phone number - FAIL
au;1;Keeps saying my phone number is incorrect
au;1;I went to sign up to the app but I can’t get past where you’re meant to enter your phone number. Despite entering my phone number correctly, the app rejects the number and says it’s not valid. I hope this gets fixed ASAP as this is such a valuable resource
au;1;The app will not go past the mobile pin code part of the registration process.
au;1;Unable to verify phone number, so unable to sign in to get required PIN number
au;2;I couldn't go past the mobile number verification page, it was showing an error even though the number is correct :(
au;2;"Govt won’t guarantee that security agencies won’t use the app to invade your privacy. 

Mobile Phone verification doesn’t work."
au;1;Please re-test the app. Phone number verification isn’t working.
au;1;Doesn’t accept mobile numbers...  you’d think they’d bet their app
au;1;Well this is disappointing. It doesn’t recognise any mobile number in our home. Useless
au;1;The app doesn’t work... you cannot sign up because of an ‘error’ with your mobile number, even though it’s correct.
au;1;"Won’t accept my valid Australian mobile number. Problem with your validation coding!
Plus you need to add note to users about first 0 in mobile number when prefix of +61"
au;1;Can’t register as app says my phone number is invalid. Why would you even put in the +61 prefix. Will confuse many. I have tried both with and without the 0!!!
au;1;Could not get my phone number verified. So seems can not use the app
au;3;I have tried without and with 0 and get “error...
au;1;Does not work when registering the phone number. Tried two separate numbers and neither work.
au;1;Won’t accept my mobile number so unable to progress any further.
au;1;Any one else seeing a error show up when entering a valid mobile number for Australia?
au;2;The app won’t let you enter your mobile number to verify. Not a good start
au;1;"No matter what you do it will not except you phone number
Not a good launch unfortunately"
au;1;It will not accept Aus phone numbers
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number.  Brings up error message.  Why should I bother.  No way of getting in contact with the developer to tell them of the error.  So I guess I’ll just not use it after all. Why?  Because I can’t.  It doesn’t work. I cannot register.
au;1;No matter how the number is entered the app won’t verify a mobile number and send the pin
au;5;Important for EVERYONE to download and use this app.  You may not be sick but you might be in contact with someone. Wouldn’t you like to me the community safe?
au;1;Can’t register phone number
au;1;I get “Error verifying phone number” when I enter my mobile number - what now?
au;1;Will not let me verify my phone number during sign up
au;1;Not great start, Error verifying phone number for PIN
au;1;It will not accept my mobile phone number, so can’t get it to work
au;1;When entering mobile phone number : receiving error message “Error verifying phone number”
au;2;Won’t except my Mobil number
au;1;Not even able to verify mobile number so not a great start!
au;3;Foolish to launch this when people can’t actually register yet. Having looked about online, the ‘invalid phone number’ issue is occurring for everyone, and ‘the back end services may only be properly switched on at 6pm.’ Well... here’s hoping!
au;1;"You’d think they’d rest it first before releasing it. It’s like the last Census - Fail!!
Can’t get past the phone number stage!!"
au;1;Can’t even register, says it has errors verifying the phone number.
au;5;Tells me my phone number is invalid
au;1;Tried to help but it won’t accept my phone number, keeps telling me it is wrong. I’m pretty sure I know my number after 20 odd years of having it.
au;1;Unable to enter phone number when registering.  Returns an error when trying to verify phone number.
au;1;Error verifying mobile number can’t even get it setup
au;1;Tried to sign up unable to verify my mobile it keeps giving me an error
au;3;"I’m stuck on the step where I enter my phone number. Entering with or without the leading zero results in “error verifying phone number”. 

Edit: so it seems the app was release before the back-end was ready. Looks like you have to wait until 6pm to register."
au;1;...please check your details and try again.
au;1;Tried to down load app stated registration but it fails to verify my mobile number. I entered the correct mobile number but the app does t work. There also seems to be no support button on the app. Terrible experience
au;1;Just tried to sign up, it wld not take my mobile number and I cld not register
au;1;Went to sign up as I believe important but could not even register properly as would not  accept my mobile phone number in any format. My husband also tried.
au;2;Can’t even register, app appears slow. Not a great start if you want people to willingly use this thing
au;1;Can’t use it as it won’t verify my mobile number. I’ve deleted the app and re-installed and have also rebooted phone. It still won’t verify the number - well done.
au;1;I put my phone number in and press the button for a PIN number and it says it’s unable to verify the number and to check my details
au;1;It won’t verify my mobile number
au;1;I can’t register - it won’t accept my mobile number. Tried many times, reloaded the app, restarted the phone, still no good.
au;1;Completely useless. App will not let me verify my mobile so cannot register.
au;1;Tried to register but keep getting the error ‘Error verifying phone number - please check your number and try again’
au;1;Won’t accept mobile phone number.
au;5;Great idea. I’m sold!
au;1;It won’t let me get past the registration of mobile number. Tried both with and without the 0 for my mobile. Error message. Also my daughter got same error message.
au;1;Installed fine and going through setup process but it keeps asking me to verify the mobile number even though it is correct - wondering if it due to having an eSim?
au;1;Great app - maybe you should do proper testing before releasing it to the public - another great govt blunder
au;1;Says unverified phone number
au;1;Unable to get past the mobile phone validation screen. Message reads “Error verifying phone number”.
au;1;Can’t register phone number to receive the 6 digit pin
au;1;Despite many attempts, app continues to reject my mobile number.. how can it not understand 10 numeric characters..?
au;1;Hi. Trying to register but when I input my mobile number I’m getting a message saying “error verifying your phone number”. I’ve tried it with and without the zero at the beginning. What now?
au;1;Will not allow me to add my phone number when registering.
au;1;The app has bug when you load your mobile number. Possible server overload . Thank you
au;1;Doesn’t like my phone number! Typical government app up there with my gov app. Glitchy can’t even sign up.
au;1;Can’t register, it won’t accept my mobile number with or without a leading 0
au;1;Won’t let me past phone number section!
au;1;Won’t recognise my phone number
au;3;Won’t accept my phone and keep getting an error

au;1;During the mobile number verification process my number could not be verified. I entered it correctly and the app wouldn’t let me submit for verification. The process failed.
au;1;Tried but it won’t recognise my mobile number
au;1;Won’t accept my mobile number with or without the starting 0 and no way to get support on it... why bother
au;1;Tried to register, but stuck on verifying phone number. Error verifying phone number.
au;1;Have tried to enter mobile phone number numerous ways to send my pin and it refuses to acknowledge any format. So can NoT use
au;1;App registration with SMS Code not working
au;1;Software testing is recommended before releasing apps. 🤡
au;5;It’s time to get to normal Australia bigger and better
au;5;Good way to get aus back to normal !
au;1;It wound recognise my mobile so can’t proceed
au;3;I realise it’s early in the release of this app, but the fundamentals aren’t even working. I can’t sign up, because it doesn’t recognise my phone number. Many people who are willing to use this app, will be discouraged by this fail straight up.
au;1;The app will not accept my mobile phone number. Perhaps it’s not ready for registration at this time.
au;1;Once you get to registering your mobile number it says it can’t verify it
au;1;Got as far as inputting my phone number for the pin and it would not accept my mobile number.
au;1;It does not accept my mobile number as a valid number even though it is correct. Strange to launch a crucial app with such basic details not figured out!
au;1;Can’t register as keep getting an error verifying phone number message
au;5;Error when verifying phone number
au;1;It won’t verify my phone number. Don’t know why.
au;1;Won’t accept my mobile no matter the form...really!!!!!!!!!!!!!
au;1;This app refuses to verify my mobile number nice one guys  What a complete and utter waste of taxpayers money 👎
au;3;Says my mobile number can’t be verified..... tried multiple times, with and without the ‘0’.
au;1;I’ve entered my mobile phone number - I know it is correct and it’s telling me it can’t verify my number - I’ve entered my number with and without the 0 in front
au;1;Can’t sign up due to phone pin not working. Black screen keeps flashing up with COVIDsafe while using the app.
au;1;I have tried on my phone and iPad and it won’t accept my phone number!
au;3;Tried to put mobile number in and it isn’t working. Tried with and without leading zero.
au;1;Won’t even let me sign up. Doesn’t recognize my mobile number I’ve had for 30 years lol.
au;2;When entering my phone number I get the error above. So it doesn't go past this point
au;1;After all that hype on television, they haven’t got the phone number registration validation process right! Thank goodness that nobody needs to pay for this app!
au;1;It’s not going to be very useful if it rejects my phone number during the setup process. The same thing happens on my wife’s phone.
au;5;Can’t add my mobile number
au;1;Great idea but not much use when it gives you an error and says it cant verify your number so cant register. No support option. Same thing happened with a friend.
au;1;Doesn’t recognise my number... tried numerous times.
au;1;Can’t register on a company mobile it appears, if that’s the case you just blew off a big chunk of the population
au;1;The app won’t recognise my mobile number! Entered both with and without ‘0’. So predictable!
au;5;There is an error sending the pin after entering mobile phone number so I can not use the app.
au;1;I fully support this app but it fails at I installation with “Error verifying phone number”. I hope it’s fixed soon, this is too important to fail
au;2;This app won’t allow me to enter in my phone number. Says there’s an error with my phone number. Can’t use the app without having my phone number attached.
au;1;I tried signing up, but keep getting “Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again”. My number is definitely correct.
au;1;Doesn’t accept my mobile number
au;1;The app is not accepting phone number. I keep getting ‘error in verifying phone number’ message. Number is 100% correct.
au;1;Good initiative if can register in the first place
au;1;Can’t get past the phone number registration page put my number in get an error message does not recognise my number.
au;2;"I tried to register and have not been able to successfully enter my mobile number for verification. 
It produces an error and says it is unable to verify my number."
au;1;Both my wife and I downloaded the app but when trying to get the pin it errors out verifying the phone number? Not a good start.
au;1;Can’t get past registration as it cannot verify my ph number
au;1;Downloaded. Failed to accept my phone number. Used both with and without a ‘0’ to start. Disappointed.
au;1;Does not allow me to enter my mobile phone number to sign up.
au;1;While I appreciate the government trying to get an App out as quickly as possible it pays to quality test before hand and have the server side infrastructure to support the influx of users. App continually crashes and error message for certifying number is not indicative of the error at hand.
au;1;‘Error verifying phone number. ‘ ummm...so it’s not actually working.
au;1;Nice work, guys 😂
au;1;I downloaded this app but I couldn’t progress past the mobile phone registration.
au;1;Phone number won’t accept either with the 0 or without.
au;1;Says my mobile number isn't correct. 🙄
au;1;Wont accept my phone number so I cannot sign up
au;1;When asked to enter your phone number to receive a verification code, it doesn’t accept my number.
au;5;I’ve tried to register using my mobile number, which I’ve had for over a decade.  Get “error verifying phone number” message. Have tried multiple times, with and without “0”. Not a great start.
au;5;What is the phone number format?  I can’t enter number ?
au;1;Attempted to register and would not accept mobile phone number
au;2;Happy to use this app but it won’t verify my phone number. I have tried multiple times
au;1;This app keeps saying the mobile number has a error
au;1;It fails mobile phone validation.... makes me think this is not a legit app
au;1;App won’t accept my mobile number to register.
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number.
au;1;Ok this app doesn’t work. I couldn’t find any way to  trace Peter Dutton back to the Ruby Princess. Also no in-app purchases for Franking Credits, hopefully a future update will have this.
au;1;Have tried on 2 phones to set up but can not as comes up error on screen saying phone number can not be verified and to try again.
au;1;"If you can’t register, you can’t use it.
Pointless until fixed."
au;1;Can’t sign up as it won’t accept my correct mobile number
au;2;The phone number verification step doesn’t work, on my phone, or my partners phone
au;1;Will not allow me to verify my phone number so cannot complete the registration process.
au;1;I tried to sign up and it keeps telling me it can’t validate my number.
au;1;Can’t verify my phone number
au;3;Unable to register. After typing in phone number following +61, I can’t “get PIN”, as it returns “error verifying phone number”. This occurs whether including the leading zero or not.
au;5;"This app is about being able to be contacted if you’ve come in contact with a COVID19 identified person.  It’s clean crisp and simple.  And single purpose.

Would have been nicer if it gave a little vibrate when your app did a handshake with another phone to prove its working - but maybe the next version."
au;1;Apparently testing is not mandatory before releasing software 🤷‍♂️
au;1;It makes sense for every single person to download this app (why not if you’ve ever used Google or Facebook?) However the app would not verify my number to send the six digit pin to authenticate. Details were correct.
au;1;Would love to participate but it literally doesn’t even get pas the register screen and won’t even let me put in my mobile number for verification. Probably rushed and will hopefully get resolved but this seems kind of obvious for testing before release...
au;1;It won’t accept my phone number and the app design is gross. I can’t wait for the Apple/Google app.
au;5;Hopefully this app wont be needed next year
au;1;App won’t move past Step 2 as will not accept valid phone number.
au;1;I started entering my details and cannot get past the phone number, tried with 0 and without 😩
au;1;Can’t error my phone number, keep getting an error message
au;1;The App provides no information about timing available for registration ! There should be a pop up communicating with the person on whose phone it is installed. Let’s hope it works better in the future.
au;1;Doesn’t accept my mob ph#.
au;1;I’m trying get my number on your app but error
au;1;It won’t save my mobile and tells to check and try again
au;1;Won’t verify my noble number
au;1;"So you need to enter your phone number to get a PIN for the next step. Apparently I don’t know my own phone number. Using iPhone software up to date. 

Fix it"
au;1;I can’t even register.
au;1;It just doesn’t work.
au;5;Works best on 5G
au;1;I enter my phone number correctly and it says can not verify it. Useless
au;2;I have tried a few Times  with 0 before mobile number and without. Says error verifying phone number
au;1;Unable to verify phone number and receive PIN
au;1;Poor
au;1;Unable to use as won’t  accept my mobile number to enable a pin to be sent
au;5;This is one of those apps that is a must to download.  In the interests of public safety everyone should be downloading it.  Let’s all crush this virus together!
au;1;I keep getting an error registering phone number. I have tried with and with out the leading 0.
au;2;I’m trying to assist and upload but it Keeps telling me my mobile number is incorrect
au;1;Not working yet.
au;1;Not great. Can’t even get past the sign up mobile number screen.
au;1;I can’t register because the shows an error message satiating it can’t verify my mobile number, which is an Australian Optus number *shrug*
au;5;Greg Hunt and Stuart Robert promised they’d quit if this app stuffed up and we got hacked.
au;5;Unable to put in my phone number to receive PIN. Deleted and redownloaded several times.
au;1;Could not receive a pin to my phone number
au;1;Errors out when attempting to register phone number (presumably can’t handle the load) and the screen intermittently blacks out. Such a simple app to get right and yet the Australian Government digital efforts fail yet again. Shameful.
au;4;The app keeps rejecting my mobile number.
au;5;Move manufacture back to Oz
au;1;Not a good start.
au;1;When I try to put my phone number in it keeps telling me the number is incorrect, but it is not. Unable to go any further.
au;1;"I keep getting an error message when trying to register.  Says “error verifying phone number” when I click on Get Pin. I am
Definitely entering my correct phone number"
au;1;I get a message of ‘Error verifying phone number’
au;5;Great idea, but getting error “Error verifying phone number” when registering (using a valid australian mobile, tried both with and without the leading zero). I’m sure your developers will have this fixed lightening fast.
au;1;Installed the app but in the registration process, it returns an error saying “error verifying phone number” - doesn’t even send a PIN to my mobile. Can’t use it past that point. It’s a brick...
au;1;Keeps saying error with phone number. Even though I triple checked it was correct. Typical aus government, can’t even get an app right 😂
au;2;Can not proceed to register
au;1;"You mustn’t have tested this real well.
It tells you there’s an error when you try to put your mobile number in.
Also a lot of people won’t know how to enter there phone number without the 0. Confusing .
I couldn’t set it up successfully .
Disgraceful that such an important ap has not been tested properly"
au;1;Won’t accept my mobile number, that I’ve had for 18 years
au;1;App tells me my phone number can’t be recognised, and therefore I can’t get a pin. Very annoying when you want to support an important initiative.
au;1;App cannot be setup because the registration process will not accept my mobile number.
au;1;It is saying my phone number is invalid but it’s not. Can’t continue without completing this step.
au;1;"App crashes. Won’t register your number to complete setup. Constantly getting error messages stating that “your phone number could not be verified”.
No help topics available on setup. Completely useless!!"
au;1;Entered my mobile number but it wouldn’t verify (tried it with and without a 0 at the start).  The government really needs to make sure the app actually works flawlessly if they expect anyone to use it.
au;1;The app won’t let me past the phone number step. I’ve tried with and without the leading 0
au;5;Government wants us to use the app, but I am not even able to register as there is error when trying to sign-up.
au;1;How are you supposed to sign up to the great weapon against the virus when it won’t accept my phone number?
au;1;I get to the mobile number part and no matter what I do it comes up with an error message.
au;1;How refreshing to see the liberal government doing some of their best, most corrupt work in the name of public safety. Why give a big contract to a local business in desperate need when you can send it offshore for the cheapest price, having our data stored overseas and the US government being legally able to seize it. Bravo Scotty from marketing. New heights.
au;4;"“Error verifying phone number”
I tried with and without the leading zero - same result."
au;3;Downloaded nice and early to help out. Registration process won’t accept my phone number. Keeps saying “error verifying number, try again”
au;1;"Just downloaded this app. Tried to register but it won’t recognise my mobile number so registration will not complete. Maybe this is just the servers overwhelmed by the rush. If so, very poor planning. 
Quite pathetic really."
au;1;I am trying to register via app on my mobile phone. It keeps giving me the error “can’t verify phone number” so I can’t  receive 6 digit pin to finalise registration.
au;1;Tried entering mobile number on step two and get a can’t verify number error...useless if you can’t even get that right 😂
au;1;It won’t accept my mobile phone number so I can’t sign up.
au;1;Can not verify mobile number. Please fix this issue ASAP the health of all Australians depends on it.
au;4;"I’ve worked in the tech industry for 20+ years and have no issue using this app...I figure it’ll help get back to our usual way of life. 

The phone verification step isn’t working though, so can you please fix it. 

Thanks."
au;2;Good effort but app won’t recognise an active mobile number to send pin for registration purpose.
au;1;Number is correct but app continues to say there was an error verifying phone number.
au;1;Can’t sign up, it doesn’t accept my mobile number.
au;1;Tried to get past mobile number step to get PIN but it fails. Two people in household have same issue. Tested 4.30pm Sunday 26th
au;3;Can register : took out the 0, then put it back but mobile number is not accepted. Registration wont proceed, no helpline to call
au;5;Can’t verify my phone number.
au;5;When I set up the app, it would not send an SMS to my registered number. Is this because it hasn’t become operational yet?
au;1;It won’t verify my phone number
au;1;"It keeps saying 

“Please check your details and try again”"
au;5;Issue with phone number verification.
au;5;Not sure if other people are also having this trouble?
au;1;The keeps telling me that the mobile phone number that I have had for over 20 years is wrong. How am I suppose to register?
au;2;It doesn’t allow me to pass the mobile number stage.. no clear error reason given apart from not accepting it.
au;1;Entering mobile number results in an error.
au;1;It asked for my mobile number to send a PIN. It kept giving error message after that step.
au;2;The app can’t even verify my mobile number, and no support option. Not a great start!
au;1;Does not recognise my mobile number
au;1;I’m trying to register and can’t get past the mobile number verification.
au;1;Attempted multiple formats, just keeps failing.
au;2;Not recognising phone number.
au;1;Keeps telling me there is an issue validating my phone number
au;1;Can’t verify. When I put in my mobile number it says can’t verify number and then can’t go any further. You would think this would have been extensible tester before releasing an app that has generated so much discussion.
au;1;Not sure why but the app does not allow verification
au;1;How does one get a PIN?  Error when I put in my mobile number. Without 0. Or with 0, it didn’t work. Back to the drawing board....
au;5;App won’t allow me to enter my number, says invalid?
au;5;Protect our community
au;1;I can’t register. There is an error message when trying to submit my phone number. Support the idea, but it needs to actually work🤦‍♂️
au;1;Can’t logon. Won’t accept my mobile phone number
au;5;Phone number verification doesn’t work. Keeps coming up with an error message
au;4;‘Error verifying phone number’ when entering all but the leading zero of my mobile number

au;1;Can’t verify phone number?
au;5;Cannot get past the second step in set-up - mobile number verification
au;1;"App won’t recognise my mobile number tried several times to set up the up..
It’s no good if doesn’t work.."
au;1;I can’t register as my mobile number keeps promoting an error message
au;1;Just downloaded the app. Failure to get past the send pin to phone number. Didn't accept my mobile number. Great start.
au;1;The app says that my phone number is not valid when I attempt to sign up.
au;1;App constantly unable to verify phone number - comes up with “Error verifying phone number - please check your details and try again” message
au;3;Can’t use the app as it won’t accept my mobile phone number . Possibly me but I’ve had the same number for 14 years .....
au;1;Apparently my mobile number is wrong? Fix it the app!!!
au;1;Won’t let me get past the mobile phone verification stage. Looks like someone forgot to test it properly?
au;1;Waiting for an update already
au;1;Want to down load it but it won’t accept my mobile number I have tried it with and without the 0
au;1;Every time I try to enter my mobile number it won’t verify and go to next step
au;5;Doesn’t work
au;1;Mobile number does not recognise when inputting.
au;1;Found the CovidSafe app link (not yet searchable in AppStore), installed the app and did the initial setup. Finally, entered my phone number to get my PIN ... fails because it ‘thinks’ my phone number is incorrect. For GOD’s sake, test this properly before you launch it — it’s not rocket science!
au;1;Won’t verify my number. Also why have +61 number? That’s only for international numbers and will confuse some users
au;5;No one is perfect, but I think you’re doing a pretty good job keeping us safe. If you think this will help, then that’s good enough for me. Thanks Scotty. Pat
au;1;Tried to sign up but it can’t verify phone number. Same error message on my son’s phone.

au;1;Errors on confirming phone number no matter which way you enter it.
au;1;Keep getting an error message when I put my phone number in for verification.
au;5;Can’t sign up as it gives me an error message about my phone number, ‘error verifying phone number, please check your details and try again’. Checked my mobile number several times, it’s definitely correct.
au;1;The word “COVIDsafe” along with a black screen keeps popping up and I can’t even register my phone number.
au;1;Submitted pound number. No code.
au;1;App doesnt recognise my phone number.
au;5;Go to enter my phone number and says to check details. Can’t get past this error.
au;1;"I am trying to install app - I get to the screen where I have to put in my mobile number in order to be sent a 6 digit code.  Despite multiple attempts, I keep getting an error message asking me to check and try again.

Can you advise?"
au;1;The app will not accept my mobile phone number. I would like to download but if it won’t accept a mobile number I won’t try until it’s fixed.  Having the +61 doesn’t help either as some will find this confusing.
au;1;So I got all the notifications to say the app had been released and to download it. Downloaded it and second step of registration and it WONT verify my mobile number hahaha. Great app. Doesn’t even work first go!??? Ps: I tried with my full 10 digit number and without the ‘0’ at the beginning and neither worked!! Will you notify us when this is fixed?
au;1;I entered my mobile number with and without the 0 at the beginning and it simply would not recognise it. I kept getting error... I’d give it a better rating if I could at least sign up
au;1;The app throws up an error at verifying the phone number
au;1;Not able to verify phone number to complete the registration. Please check
au;1;Tried to sign up and I get stuck on the phone number verification part. Comes up with an error message “Error verifying phone number please check your details and try again”
au;1;"It doesn’t even try to send me a PIN.
Just doesn’t like my phone number..."
au;1;"There is an issue entering your phone number on the app. ‘Error verifying phone number ‘ 
Which means I cannot install it."
au;1;I am unable to get past the mobile number section.   Keeps telling me  it having trouble verifying my mobile number     Cant help out if i cant sign up
au;1;Won’t recognise my phone number
au;3;Get to phone number registration and says “Error Verifying phone number” my number is correct.
au;1;Installed the app and while trying to register my mobile number I’m getting an error message “Error verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again”. I must have tried at least 5 times with and without 0 at the beginning of my mobile number.
au;1;Won’t accept my phone number to validate! Makes it useless!!
au;1;I’m really happy to be involved. Downloaded the app and it won’t accept my mobile number to send me a PIN!! Of course there’s no contact info anywhere....
au;5;"Won’t accept my mobile and send me the pin. 
Double checked all is correct."
au;5;I have tried 04xxxxxxxx and 4xxxxxxxx, both numbers can’t be identified.
au;1;Tried to sign up and it won’t let me get past adding my phone number. It said it can’t be verified even though it’s entered correctly.
au;2;Why allow the download when it won’t validate the phone number?  If it’s not operational until 6pm, why not have an elegant error message?
au;1;I can't even sign up, the app won't recognise my mobile number as real
au;1;Despite having the same phone number for the past 25 years with Telstra - I get ‘error verifying phone number.  So can’t register

au;1;Wont accept my phone number so can’t register???
au;1;The app will not accept my phone number
au;1;Won’t let me get a pin when I try to verify my number. Just says check info and try again.
au;1;Stuart Robert design this app? 😒
au;1;They didn’t release the code open source as promised. No idea what they are actually doing with our data
au;5;It says there is an error verifying my phone number, yet all my details are correct. I have attempted to set up multiple times with no success.
au;1;It won’t recognise my phone number
au;2;I am for this initiative, however unable to register as it says ‘error verifying phone number’
au;1;Trying to put my mobile number and it keeps telling me there’s an error. I’ve tried typing the number with and without the zero - doesn’t work
au;1;"This app has failed in two ways. First, you need to have this app always running with your phone fully unlocked all the time to make it work. This is how iOS was designed to prevent privacy abuse, apps in background do not get a change to always broadcast data via bluetooth.

The government had a chance to avoid this problem because Apple and Google are coming up with their own contact tracing solution that they could implement in this app (Contact Tracing framework) but the government decided not to use it.

Secondly, they ask you to provide your contact details at the point of the registration. They could do that when you are notified about contacting someone with the virus instead. There is no real reason to collect this information for every single person and store it on a server."
au;3;I’m using on its first day so I’m sure this is a just a teething problem.
au;1;Phone number doesn’t verify.
au;2;Can’t use app as it says my phone number is wrong
au;1;Doesn't accept phone number neither does google play app my husband downloaded.
au;5;Getting error verifying phone number even after giving a valid number. Tried with both 04 and 4.
au;1;"Love the concept of the app - just a pity it can’t even verify my phone number to let me join. Doesn’t give much confidence for the engineering of the app if I can’t even get my
number verified."
au;2;Seriously. First bug
au;1;Won’t verify phone number
au;1;I’m trying to download when I enter my mobile it won’t accept it
au;4;Registration process not yet activated
au;1;App fails to recognise my phone number to send a pin code
au;5;I’m so glad to see the Australian Government taking such a pro-active step towards monitoring this pandemic.  The legislation and policies associated with the privacy controls of this app are very reassuring.
au;1;"I have an Australian mobile number, getting a consistent error saying I haven’t entered a valid mobile number. 

Can’t finish sign up. 👎🏻"
au;2;Downloaded and signed up but it won’t accept my mobile number to send me a pin to verify it. Frustrating.
au;3;Can’t verify phone number as says error
au;1;This App is a invasion of privacy! The Government can’t be trusted.
au;1;keeps saying error verifying number to get pin
au;5;"When I walk down to Bondi and see everyone not social distancing, I think to myself “let’s nuke the site from orbit”. But with this app, I feel like Ed Snowden would be rolling over in his grave if he died from covid-19. 
Too bad Ed, you had your chance"
au;1;"Disappointing that this App has been released without a working registration process. It fails when you enter your mobile number. 

As someone who is keen to see this in place I’m very supportive of the approach. They would have been better to wait than release an app that doesn’t work"
au;1;Mobile PIN option is not working..please further test
au;1;I am fully supportive of this new app, however I could not get passed the phone number verification. Not impressed.
au;2;hello! i've entered my number but it keeps saying that it's incorrect ?!?!? something the problem??! that's my number tho??
au;5;A very good app for tracing and stopping coronavirus
au;4;Please help!
au;3;Can't get past the phone verification. Not receiving SMS
au;1;Can't register, won't recognise 0472 mobile numbers. You'd think the government would know how Australian phone numbers work.
au;1;Not working
au;1;Can’t use it
au;4;Am unable to verify mobile number
au;1;"App region is set to US not Australia had to change my settings to allow install 

could not verify active mobile number with or without 0 could not complete setup"
au;5;Please download this.
au;1;Downloaded the app minutes after it became available. Couldn’t register because it couldn’t verify my mobile number. This may be a congestion issue (too many people registering) or a fault in the app but either way it’s a big fail.
au;1;Not a great start . when asked for my mobile phone number, was unable to complete registration. “Error verifying phone number”. Entered valid 9 digit mobile number starting with number 4
au;3;Can’t get past the phone Number info
au;1;"Cannot complete the initial sign-up. 
“Error verifying phone number” for both full number and dropping the leading zero. Oh well.  Not much use if you can’t get the very first steps to work.."
au;4;"Seems pretty simple to get setup. Registration not open yet so it tells me it can't validate my number. 

6pm is go live. Will have to go hunt down the virus to test all features of the app."
au;5;Great app that meets all my privacy concerns.
au;1;Can’t sign up. There is an error when trying to get PIN number sent to you.
au;1;Keen to help out, get to the second step of registering and despite putting my mobile number in many times, it’s telling me it’s wrong.
au;1;Can’t get past log in stage
au;3;I'm unable to verify my mobile number, keeps saying invalid mobile number, when it's correct. Unable to set up as a result pls resolve
au;5;🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎
au;1;Literally only installing this so they can track my incredibly boring personal information, hopefully it’ll waste a bit of their time
au;2;Won’t accept mobile number
au;5;The virus kills people. If you don’t install this app you aren’t doing “everything you can” to help save people’s lives. That simple.
au;5;Great initiative by Australian Government.
au;5;Hoping this helps!
au;5;No issues with installing for iPhone. Mobile number registration went without any issues. Thank you everyone for your tireless work and effort to protect Australia from Covid-19! 🙏
au;4;To those saying their phone number won’t work, leave out the starting zero - start at the 4
au;5;"Downloaded and registered with my mobile number in less than 10 minutes. 

Melbourne."
au;5;Installed and setup easily
au;1;I don’t have an Australian mobile number. The app doesn’t allow foreign numbers. Oh well
au;5;Download on IPhone XR easy and works fine. Both wifi and network. All good so far.
